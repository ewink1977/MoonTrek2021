		<p>
			The stories are a serialization, so they won't make much sense if
			you start with the last novel (though it will be better written,

		<h2 class="bebas">What Is Moon Trek?</h2>
		<p>
			Moon Trek is a crossover fan fiction that takes characters from the
			Ranma Â½ world, the Sailor Moon world, and original characters that I
			created and places them in the post-Dominion War Star Trek universe.
			I started the series long before the new movies and series, so my
			universe is just my mind-canon of things that take place after Deep
			Space Nine.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the past two plus decades, the characters and story have
			evolved from a simple 'LOL WOULDN'T IT BE FUNNY IF RANMA WAS CAPTAIN
			OF A SPACESHIP TROLOLOLOL' concept into something I tried to turn
			into a serious writing exercise as I developed both a love for
			writing and a love for the story and characters that I created and
			developed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The series is a serial; you can't just start with NEO4. Each story
			feeds off the previous in one way or another, especially throughout
			the series; whether it's Moon Trek, NEO or Trinity.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the tenth full length story complete, the series is now
			finished. With that said, I have three side stories that take place
			in (more or less) the same universe that I plan to publish soon, so
			there is more content coming... For some reason.

		<h2 class="bebas">What is the LCARS Database?</h2>
		<p>
			The LCARS Database is a character, ship, and story background and
			information site. It contains information that will provide you with
			information that comes from the stories and various other sources
			(by which I mean my - the author's - arse). This information will
			give away plot points and pretty much tell you the end of the
			stories if you have not read them.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have not read the stories, I highly recommend that you do not
			read these pages. If you are simply a 'Star Trek' fan and you want
			to get basic information on the anime characters, you really don't
			need to as the characters really evolve out of their anime roles by
			the second or so story. (I'm that terrible, or that good. Both could
			be true, from a certain point of view.)
		</p>
		<p>
			However if you do want to learn about the canon characters before
			reading the stories, you can check out my
			<a
				href="https://funkdafied.douglasavenue.com"
				target="_blank"
				class="external_link"
				>Ranma 1/2</a
			>
			site, and Google a million or so Sailor Moon sites.
		</p>
		<p>
			The database is still a work in progress, so there may be some
			issues or missing data. There's also a lot of stuff that's hidden
			inside of the database (e.g. stuff that doesn't have links from any
			of the main pages), so if you've got nothing better to do with your
			life, or you're trapped on a snow-stuck train, you should snoop
			around!
