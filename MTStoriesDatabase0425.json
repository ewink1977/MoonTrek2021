Ranma leans back in his chair, his very comfortable chair. The chair he&rsquo;s worked his ass off for. Boy, would Akane be pissed. She&rsquo;s working her way up to Captain as well. But she has a long way to go. She needs to work on controlling her temper.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma remembers a fun incident that happened once with Akane. Well, it was fun for him because he wasn&rsquo;t involved. It wasn&rsquo;t fun for the eleven crewmen with severe phaser burns. It turns out that calling Akane&rsquo;s cooking &lsquo;Klingon crap&rsquo; when she was close to the phaser rifle locker was not a smart idea.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regardless, he was glad he was in a meeting at the time. This had happened when he and Akane were stationed aboard the U.S.S. Minneapolis. He was the XO, and she was chief of security. That thought still made Ranma shudder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain,\" A voice behind Ranma said. The voice was from his tactical officer, and Chief of Security, Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, Lieutenant?\" Ranma answered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We just received a message from the space dock. They say the last of the crew has boarded.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thank you, Mousse.\" Ranma grinned. He was looking forward to his XO getting to the bridge. Rumor had it she was a hottie. The strange thing about this assignment was that he wasn&rsquo;t able to pick his officers. An unnamed Admiral had done it. The other strange thing was that he wasn&rsquo;t given a list of who his officers were.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The turbolift doors opened. The hissing of the doors always startled Ranma. With all the technology of the 24th century, you would think they could make silent hydraulics.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before Ranma could stand to see who it was, a voice greeted him. A familiar voice. A voice that made Ranma want to run for the nearest airlock.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"NIHAO!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned slowly but was taken down by an over-hyper Amazon girl. Shampoo had Ranma on the floor of the bridge, and she was in no hurry to let him up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sh-Shampoo?\" Ranma stuttered. \"What - I mean, - What are you doing here?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo giggled. \"Silly Ranma! Shampoo new XO!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Oh, Lord.</em> Ranma tried to manage a smile, and get up, but it was somewhat hopeless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">WHOOSH! The turbolift doors again. Another voice bellowed his name. He wasn&rsquo;t sure whether he was more afraid of Shampoo or this one. His fianc&eacute;e.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RANMA!!\" Akane screamed. \"Maybe I came at the wrong time. I thought maybe we were going to go and, oh I don&rsquo;t know, WORK?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane!? This isn&rsquo;t what it looks like!\" Ranma regretted saying that. He has learned in his years that using that line was like throwing Pop Rocks into a soda. Did a hell of a lot more harm than good.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma finally managed to get out from underneath Shampoo. He sat her down in her chair and ran after Akane, who had stormed off into his ready room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane. Uh - Well, hi?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ranma.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane I - Well&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ranma, forget it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Um, Ok. Uh, what are you doing here?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane grew a look on her face. It was half &lsquo;what don&rsquo;t you want me here?&rsquo; and &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you know?&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I&rsquo;ve been assigned as the Chief Medical Officer.\" She said, sitting down on the couch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma started to laugh until he realized that she was serious.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"CMO? But, you don&rsquo;t have any medical experience.\" Ranma slowly sat next to her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don&rsquo;t you think I know that?\" Akane shouted back, somewhat defensively. \"Your stupid dad sent me here, and since this is the only position available, well, this is where I am.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nearly fell over where he heard those two words. \"My Dad?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane nodded. \"People at Starfleet Command call him Admiral Panda.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma did fall over this time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"MY DAD IS AN ADMIRAL?!?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What? Didn&rsquo;t you know?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Obviously not!\" Ranma began to pace his ready room. His father was an admiral. And he was responsible for this mess. Not that he was too upset having Akane aboard, but it was the other things. A man, who is nearly blind working his weapons, and her, Shampoo. His XO. For some reason, God wasn&rsquo;t happy with him this week.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ranma?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"If you want me to leave -\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don&rsquo;t be stupid, stupid. I need a CMO. And you&rsquo;re it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane stood up and walked over to Ranma. She then proceeded to flatten him with a semi-large mallet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Fine. Just don&rsquo;t call me stupid.\" Akane then stormed out of the room. Ranma sighed and sat down on his couch.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma was on his third cup of coffee. He had started to read about the Finden system. Seems they have two Class M planets. It was odd that the ships were only bothering one of them. Maybe the other one had a secret alliance with whoever these people are.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma&rsquo;s communicator chirped.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Wo Ai Ni Ranma! Ship ready to go. Just no helmsman!\" Shampoo cheerfully reported.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Odd. Ranma stood up and walked out of his ready room, coffee in hand. He walked onto the bridge. He now saw his Ops officer. She stood to greet him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good morning, Captain!\" The nearly drop dead beautiful blonde said. \"Lt. Commander Mina Aino.\" The two shook hands.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Welcome aboard, Commander.\" Ranma grinned, trying to maintain eye contact. Maybe this would be a good time to find out who, and where his helmsman is.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Number One - \" Ranma started, but was interrupted by &lsquo;Number One&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"HI-YA!

Ranma chose to ignore the growling coming from the tactical station.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo. That&rsquo;s what I call my first officer. Now you need to stop this, or I will assign you to photon torpedo tube cleaning!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo almost seemed hurt, but she still managed to hold on to her smile. \"Aye Captain. What was you were speaking?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you know who our helmsman is or where he is?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo no know.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Does anyone know?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Meanwhile somewhere in the drive section of the craft &ndash;</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHERE ON EARTH AM I NOW?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer chirped back. \"You are not on Earth.

Space doors opening!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo turned to the viewscreen. \"Ryouga. Increase speed to 500 KPH. Once clear of big doors, set course 1-2-3 mark 2-0-9. Warp six\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am.\" Ryouga complied. Ranma looked somewhat worried still. There was not that much extra room for the ship to get through the doors safely. But, all he has to do is keep her even and keep her going straight and - We're high. Ranma stood right up. Shampoo screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"TOO HIGH! GO DOWN GO DOWN!\" Shampoo screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ship was not going to clear the top of the doors. As a matter of fact, the ship was going to completely miss the doors by about 100 meters too high!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RYOUGA! Z MINUS 350 METERS! NOW!!!\" Ranma screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga was frantically hitting buttons. Random button-pushing on a trillion-dollar starship is another thing that should be on the 'bad idea' list.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ship started to do barrel rolls. Shampoo decided to scream again and hit the deck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SHIT! FULL STOP! HIT THE BREAKS!\" Ranma screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga hit a button. He then said \"Oops.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma's jaw hit the deck now. \"Oops?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sisko had turned completely upward and was flying at 800 KPH towards the roof of the space dock.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma ran over to Mina's console. \"AINO!! TAKE HELM! STOP US!!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina started running her hands over her panel. Ryouga's went blank, and the helm configuration popped up on hers. She began to hit buttons, trying to stop the ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse picked this time to freak out. \"10 SECONDS TO COLLISION WITH THE ROOF OF THE SPACE DOCK!\" Mousse began to run in circles, losing his glasses in the process.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"MOUSSE! SHIELDS UP!\" Ranma yelled, the tension in his voice. He was rarely scared, but at this moment, he was scared shitless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse ran to his panel and hit a few buttons. A familiar sound was heard, but it was not the sound of the shields.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Outside from the front of the ship, a red glowing sphere flew towards the roof. Ranma knew what it was. He turned to Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Did you just -\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Fire a torpedo? Yes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aw swell.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain,\" Mina whimpered. \"I shut down the engines, but we have too much forward motion. Even with reverse thrusters at full, we're going to collide!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was at this time the torpedo hit the roof of the space dock, blowing a hole in it. The ship managed to float right through this new exit, and safely into open space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma could only just stare at the screen. All the stars seemed to look like his ass being kicked by Rear-Admiral Happosai. The COM panel behind him beeped. Mousse, who had found his glasses, answered it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain, Rear-Admiral Happosai for you. He doesn't sound happy.\" Mousse sniveled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly Happosai's face appeared on the viewer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"DOESN'T SOUND HAPPY IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!\" The short man bellowed. \"DON'T YOU MORONS KNOW HOW TO USE THE DOOR?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked up at the admiral. \"Sorry?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is another term Ranma had learned usually does more bad than good. This time, it seemed to make Happosai's face change from the beet red it was, to a mixture of beet red and really pissed off blue.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SORRY? YOU BETTER BE! THE NEW ROOF IS COMING OUT OF ALL YOUR PAYCHECKS! NOW GET TO FINDEN NOW!\" The screen returned to stars. Ranma walked over to Shampoo and helped her up. Shampoo was still in shock, so she didn't even think of glomping onto Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, Number One. You heard him. Set a course to the Finden system. Warp eight this time. And also, call a staff meeting of all the senior staff in the conference room in ten minutes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo only had the ability to nod at Ranma, as he walked into his ready room to cry. There goes the Lexus!</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane had just made herself comfortable in her office chair again. The jostling of the ship had knocked her on her ass several times. She finally decided she would just stay on the floor till everything was better. It finally stopped. She sat back in her chair propped her feet up and then the chirp. She hated the chirp.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, they weren't polite enough to use the comm badges to contact her. They used the ships comm. system. Which of course was on the other side of sickbay.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The chairs here may be comfortable, but the designers need to have a mental evaluation,\" Akane grumbled out loud to herself. A couple of medical techs threw a look her way, but she dismissed it. Just because she talked to herself doesn't mean she was crazy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Does it?\" She asked no one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It pissed her off to no end when she found out it was Shampoo on the other end of the communication. Then she found out she would have to trek all the way up to the bridge for a conference.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, they can't put the conference room in a more central location, can they?!\" She growled. She noticed the techs checking her out again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"AS YOU WERE!\" She screamed. The techs ran to a different part of sickbay.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane just starts to walk out of sickbay when her door slides open. A young blonde girl with really odd hair walks, no hobbles in. She's bawling up a storm. Akane rushes right over to her and helps her up onto an exam table.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you OK?\" Akane asks the girl.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WAAAAAAAA! I think not! I think I broke my epidermal!\" The poor slob of a girl cries. Akane has no idea what the girl is talking about, but it works out okay because the girl doesn't have any clue either.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane grabs her tricorder and scans the girl. It appears she sprained her ankle. She sure is making a big deal out of it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's about this time Akane notices the pips on her collar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lt. Commander?!\" Akane gasps out loud. What kind of Lt. Commander is this kind of a cry baby?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes?\" The girl responded between sobs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's your name?\" Akane walked over to a cabinet, hoping to find the sprain-fixer-thingamajig.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Serena. Serena Tsukino.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, Commander, you have a sprained ankle. No biggie, easy to fix. I think.\" Akane walked back over. She found some device that looked like it should work, so she decided to try it. She ran the device over Serena's bad ankle. She then checked it with the tricorder. It worked. The ankle was good as new.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Serena. Tell me how you did this.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well Doc, I was in engineering and when the ship shifted real hard earlier, I fell down and, well, you know the rest.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane was confused now.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What were you doing in engineering? That place is very dangerous.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena giggles. \"That's what I keep telling them, but they said since I am Chief Engineer, I need to spend a majority of my workday down there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane collapses. \"YOU!? You're the Chief Engineer?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yup. Funny isn't it?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure. In sadistic whips and chains sort of way.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah.\" Akane tried to chuckle. \"I guess you need to go to that staff meeting too then, huh?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah.\" Serena grins. \"Do you want to walk up there together?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah!\" Akane nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena goes to hop off the exam table but ends up on her face.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WAAAAAAA!!\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Farther down in the saucer section of the ship was the ship's councilor's office. The young lady who got that job was busy unpacking, and it took Shampoo a couple of tries to get her attention.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This kid was pissed. Seems to be a recurring theme with this crew. She had finally gotten the picture of her Grandpa to hang straight when BOOM! The whole damn ship shook, not only knocking it crooked but right off the wall. She decided that she wasn't going to get to that meeting until she got the picture set up again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a few seconds of fidgeting with it, she got it going. She smiled. The first time she has smiled since she was transferred off of the moon colony. She didn't want this assignment, but she wanted to move up the ranks. Right now she held the rank of Lt. Commander, but she wanted to be a captain. But, that's everyone in Starfleet's goal. And as anyone will tell you, you won't become a captain sitting behind a desk.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The last thing she needed to do was put her name plaque on her desk. It's a special name plaque. It was given to her by an old friend of hers, that she hasn't seen for years. The plaque had her name inscribed, and a rose painted on it as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well, now that that's done, time to get to the bridge. She walked out of her office, and the door hissed shut behind her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Damn that hiss!\" She murmured. She hated that hiss more than just about anything. Even the automatic doors at Wal-Mart in the freakin' 20th century were quiet!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As she walked down the hallway towards the turbolift, she couldn't help but notice that there were some very handsome men on this ship. Even though she had no interest in being here she did have to acknowledge that it could do wonders for her love life. There were times when she didn't worry about those kinds of things, but it was different now. After he reportedly died at the hands of Mad Cow infected Big Mac, she stopped looking for men. She thought that the whole universe had it out for her. It was bad enough that he was DESTINED to be with someone else but just as they started to have some problems he died. Why did everything bad happen to her?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was lucky for her though her grandpa had her apply at Starfleet Academy. While she was at the academy she met lots of men. But no one warned her about San Francisco. All the men were gay. Even the Vulcan ones! But they did teach her a few things about herself, including dealing with her bisexuality.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eventually, she arrived at a turbolift. She had the distinct problem of always talking the longest route to turbolifts. She hated meetings, so she was never in a hurry to get to them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The girl hit the call button and frustratedly taps her foot while she waits. She also hated waiting for a turbolift. For something called 'turbo', they sure as hell didn't move very fast. Lucky for her she doesn't have to wait long. Before she knew it the doors slid open. She nearly passed out when she saw who was in it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Serena?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena turned away from Akane and looked at the girl. Her eyes widened and teared up. She hadn't seen this old friend in years.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RAYE!\" Serena embraced Raye in a tight hug. Raye returned the hug. Even though the two of them didn't get along that well, they were still very good friends. When the group of five split up, they figured they would never meet again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye and Serena walked back into the turbolift. The doors hissed shut and the lift continued on its trip to the bridge. Serena turned to Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane, this is Raye Hino. A very good friend of mine.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane and Raye shook hands. \"Nice to meet you, Raye. I am the ship&rsquo;s CMO. What do you do?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye smiled. \"I'm the ship&rsquo;s counselor.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh! So you are headed in the same direction as Serena and I!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nodded. \"It would appear that way. Serena, what on Earth are you doing here? And what are you doing wearing Lt. Commander pips?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena giggled. \"I'm the ship's Chief Engineer.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A look of doom came over Raye. \"Wow, Serena. Someone must dislike the people on this ship.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena started the waterworks. \"I haven't seen you in years and you're still mean to me! WAAAAAAAAA!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye put her hand on Serena's shoulder. \"Serena, you know I am just kidding.\" Raye turns towards the front of the lift car. \"Sort of.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift came to a stop. The doors hissed open. The group stepped out onto the bridge. Akane looked around. \"Where's Ranma?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo walked up to Akane. \"Ranma in ready room. Shampoo in charge. What you want?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We're here for the meeting you called.\" Akane fumed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Go to conference room. We be in shortly.\" Shampoo walked down the ramp and back into the Captain's chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, Akane. I see you two are good friends.\" Raye mused.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane just let out a half chuckle half grunt as she led the others into the conference room.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane, Serena, and Raye were in a conversation of their own when Ranma, Shampoo, Mousse, Mina, and Ryouga walked into the room. Raye and Serena gleefully stood up and ran to Mina when they saw her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mina! Long time!\" Raye said!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I've missed you, Mina!\" Serena added.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina smiled. \"And I missed you, my friends.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma just stood there grinning. \"I see you are all aquatinted! This will save us some time. Let's all be seated and get this over with. For those of you who don't know me, I am Captain Ranma Saotome. I will go around the table, so, to my left is our XO, Commander Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Next to her is our Chief of Security, and Tactical Officer, Lt. Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Next is our - \" Ranma has to pause and try and figure out the logic behind this one. \"- our Chief Helm Officer, Ensign Ryouga Hibiki.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nice steering out of the space dock, Ensign.\" Raye scorned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Be nice, counselor.\" Ranma shot at her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes sir.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga just stuck his tongue out at Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ensign!\" Ranma spat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?!\" Ryouga whimpered, trying his best to sound innocent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Next to Ryouga is our Chief Medical Officer, Akane Tendo. As long as you don't let her make your chicken soup, you'll be OK.\" Ranma ducks a flying tricorder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Over here to my right is Lt. Commander Mina Aino. She's our Operations Officer and Chief Science Officer. Next to her is Lt. Commander Raye Hino. Raye is the ship's counselor. If you have any problems, I am sure she would be more than happy to help you out.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye, without being seen, shoots a 'yeah thanks a lot' look at Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And last, but certainly not least, next to Miss Hino is Lt. Commander Serena Tsukino. She is our Chief Engineer.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma paused for a few seconds, allowing everyone to throw a 'nice to meet you' nod at each other. He then continued.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I think this will be one of the best crews Starfleet has ever assembled. I also think that with a lot of hard work, we can achieve things that no other ship has ever achieved. The Sisko is the most advanced ship ever built by the Federation. We should be very careful not to scratch her up.\" Ranma rolled his eyes toward Ryouga. \"Anymore.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye leans over to Mina. \"Yeah. New record. Ship to have the fastest warp core breach out of space dock.\" Mina just gives her the 'be nice' look.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"There will be a reception for you all in ten-forward at 18:00. I look forward to seeing you all there. First, let's take care of some business. Commander Aino, what's our ETA to Finden?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina punches something up on her computer. \"Twelve hours, Seven minutes sir.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good.\" Ranma grinned. \"Time for some work, and some play. Dismissed all. Oh, Miss Hino, if you could, when you're not with a patient, please be on the bridge? In case we run into anyone where I could use your insight.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nods. \"Yes, captain.\" She rolls her eyes. Good thing I'm booked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thank you.\" Ranma smiles as Raye walks off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walks over to the observation windows. He gazes out at the stars flying by. He never understood how that if they are going faster than the speed of light you could see the stars to each side and behind the ship, but he wasn't worried about things like that. It was pretty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane walks up next to him. \"You really think this is one of the best crews?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turns to Akane, then back to the stars. \"No. We're screwed.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane turns to Ranma. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, one, my XO won't keep her hands - uh - \" Ranma notices how Akane is looking at him. \"hands off my computer. My CMO has no medical experience.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hey,\" Akane interjects. \"I cured a sprained ankle today.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, I'm proud of you. But we will have more than sprained ankles if this report is true.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What report?\" She asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I got a report from Starfleet Command a little while ago. The Kuno activity in the outer region is increasing. That's why they are sending us to Finden. The Federation doesn't give a damn about the ships. They're annoying, sure, but not something to send its most armed ship too.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh, I see.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"My Chief Engineer has had more on-the-job accidents than the entire explosives team, the dangerous situations team and the on-purpose accidents team had combined!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She was the one with the sprained ankle.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Figures. Our counselor has been reprimanded for being mean to the patients. My weapons officer is blind and my helmsman is an idiot!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What about Commander Aino?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She's a good officer, but she's never been in combat before. She&rsquo;d be perfect if all we were up to was charting nebulas.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh. Seems your Dad wasn't happy with you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It would seem not.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane sighed. \"Well, come on down to ten-forward. Have a few drinks. It'll make you feel better.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma laughed. \"That's all this ship needs, a drunk Captain. Can you imagine that? A drunk captain.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane starts to walk away. \"18:00. I will be expecting you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighs an acknowledgment. The doors hiss shut behind Akane.

Then, splash!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"BRAGGH!\" Genma-Panda explains to his son while holding up a sign. &lt;Sorry, son! Can't talk! On my way to a diplomatic mission!&gt;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The screen popped up to the United Federation of Planets logo and the phrase 'Transmission Terminated.'</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"DAMN!\" Ranma yells.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">END OF FLASHBACK. WE NOW RETURN YOU TO YOUR READING</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma set his head down on his desk. He was damn near ready to start crying again, but a sudden feeling came over him. It was the 'If I do well I will show the old man a thing or two' feeling. Ranma sat up. Yes, that was how he was going to get his dad back. He was going to get his crew into shape and have them kicking ass by the end of the day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stood up and walked out onto the bridge. He noticed none of his senior officers were there. He looked at his watch and realized that no one in the future wore watches. He looked over a no-name's shoulder at his panel. 1825. Everyone was down in ten-forward.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He didn't want to go, but he had promised Akane. He also thought to himself that he could use a drink. Ranma wasn't really a drinker, but when he thought about his crew another feeling came over him. This feeling must have been the 'maybe if I get drunk they'll fire me and I can go back to lifeguarding at the Y'. Ranma didn't much care for that either, mainly because he had to stay in female form, but it was a living. Besides, he met those nice village people. Funny how he got along with them better when he was in his male form.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded to himself in approval and skipped into the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Deck ten.\" He told the computer. The lift buzzed to life and whisked the captain to meet what might be his new friend. A man named Jack. Jack Daniels.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In ten-forward, there were a lot of people chatting with each other. There was also music playing. Some of the crew was near the windows dancing. Serena was one of them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Actually, it seemed more like Serena was going into an epileptic seizure than dancing, but whatever floats your boat. After she knocked over the sixth crewmember, she sulked her way over to the bar and had a seat with Raye and Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye was the first to start ragging on Serena about her dancing if you can call it that.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Serena.\" She slurred. It would appear that Raye is drunk. \"What do you call that dance you were doing up there?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena, not realizing that Raye was being sarcastic, grinned. \"I call that the 'Funky Monkey!'\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye laughed heartily. \"I would call it the 'Help my finger's caught in a light-bulb socket'. It sucked girl!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina just shook her head as Serena started to sniffle.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Serena, don't listen to her.\" Mina comforted. \"She's drunk and she doesn't know what she's saying.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye shook her head. \"I know what I'm saying! I'm saying that Serena sucks!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena let out one of her patented bawls, as she bolted from the bar, and out the door.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SERENA!\" Mina called after her. But, it was too late. When she's upset that girl can really sprint.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye turned to Mina and grabbed her shoulder. \"Let her go. She knows I was just giving her a hard time. She'll get over it. She always does.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina was still upset with Raye, and this time her half-assed explanations weren't going to get her out of a lecture.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Raye. Serena is a sensitive girl. She can't handle criticism like you and I. I know you just think that your giving her the riot act is all in fun, but she doesn't understand that. I want you to apologize to her. What do you say?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye just looked Mina in her baby blues, and said, \"I have to pee. Excuse me.\" Raye stumbled off her seat and headed towards the restrooms. Mina just chugged the rest of her drink.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Women problems, eh?\" A deep voice says to Mina. She looks up. The voice belongs to the bartender. The bartender is a handsome man with dark hair pulled back into a ponytail. He had a goatee and was wearing a 'Home of the Whopper' apron over his Starfleet uniform. He didn't have any rank pips on his collar, making Mina assume that he was just an enlisted crewman.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina laughed at the remark. \"Yeah, my friend Raye is always being mean to our other friend, Serena.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bartender laughed. \"Well, I feel that they really care for each other deep down.\" Mina nodded in agreement.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"But I still wish she would be nice to her. Serena is a great girl, who's far away from home. She's just a bit clumsy, and somewhat ditzy, and not very organized-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bartender cut her off. \"I get the point. However, I should note that we aren't really THAT far from Earth if you acknowledge how far away some other ships are.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina thought about this for a second. \"You know what I mean though.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man nodded. He noticed Mina's empty glass. \"Another?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded her approval and slid her glass towards him. He walks over and fills her up. \"So what's your name?\" He asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mina. Mina Aino.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nice to meet you, Mina. I'm Gosnell.\" They shook hands.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Any relation to the Gosnell the class of the ship is named after?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell pondered this for a second. \"You know, I've often wondered that myself. See, I think the class was named after a human named Gosnell. I'm not human.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh? What race are you?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am from a very distant planet known as Cantrell. The Kunos destroyed my home over a thousand years ago. They swept down and assimilated everyone in sight. Lucky for me I was gobbled up by a tornado, unrelated to the attack, and was somehow shot into space where an old man named Gargle Listerine saved me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina was impressed. This guy was over a thousand years old. And he survived one of those damn shooting tornados. \"So how did you end up here?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, that story is somewhat embarrassing. I bet the captain in a poker game that if he won I would be his bartender on his ship, and then follow him till he died, or till I got bored. Well, he beat me. All I had were a 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace of hearts. He had four sevens.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Um, Gosnell. I hate to tell you this but you had a royal straight flush. That beats what the captain had.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The look on Gosnell's face could have shattered glass. He hung his head in shame. \"Where were you before I signed that two-hundred-year contract?\" Gosnell grabbed a bottle of vodka and downed it in one gulp.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You going to be ok?\" Mina asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am now. This stuff is STRONG!\" Gosnell grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was about this time that Raye comes straggling back to her seat. She looks up to Gosnell.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hit me.\" She says.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell shrugs and draws back, and WACK! He punches Raye right in the jaw. Raye looks up and glares at Gosnell with a look that could have broken Gosnell's earlier look.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WITH A DRINK YOU MORON!\" Raye screams at Gosnell. Gosnell shrugs and grabs Mina's drink. He then throws the contents in Raye's face.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye leans over the bar and grabs the now frightened Gosnell by his collar. \"I want you to put some Rum and some Coke into a glass and then set it on the bar, right here in front of me. If you hit me or throw another drink in my face I will rip all your hairs out one by one and toss you into a quantum torpedo tube and shoot you up the ass of a Klingon elephant. Got it?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell nods and runs off to make the drink. Raye sits back down and wipes herself off. She notices Mina chuckling silently.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT?!\" Raye scowls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nothing.\" Mina grins.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was about this time when the Captain walks into ten-forward. He glances around the room. No Akane. Just like her. Bitch and moan and whine to get me down here, but she's not down here herself. Well, at least Shampoo isn't down here either.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned and walked up to the bar. He takes a seat next to Raye. He looks and grins.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Counselor. Commander. How are you two?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye looks at him slowly and tries to force a grin. \"I'm happy!\" Raye's head then smacks the bar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina turns to Ranma as well, with a more sincere grin on her face, and doing a much better job of holding her head up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm good Captain. Looking forward to getting to the Finden system.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The captain smiled back at Mina and sent a chuckle to the back of Raye's head. He then looked up at Gosnell. \"Hey, Gosnell. Hit me with water. Can't get drunk. On duty.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell grinned. \"Coming right up!\" He walked on over to the replicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma started to feel concerned about Raye. \"Is she OK?\" He asked Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina starts to answer when Gosnell walks back and throws the Captain's water in his face. Ranma becomes Ranma-chan (RC).</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The look on Mina's face was one of shock. Of all her years in the Starfleet Science Corps, she had never seen a man change into a woman. Well, she thought. Do changelings count? Mina began to wonder about this. What if the captain was a founder? Think of all the press coverage she'd get if she found him out. Swarms and swarms of men would be swooning over her. Over Mina Aino. The savior of the federation!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Granted the war was over and the Founders were pretty much out of the picture, but one serving, as the captain of Starfleet's new flagship, has to be considered a big deal!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina stealthily looked to the captain. He was still thinking of some swear words to use on Gosnell. This was her chance. If she could get some blood from him, she would be able to prove he was a changeling.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina started darting her eyes all over. No one in the whole room had a medical hypospray. Gosnell having removed the medkits earlier for some unexplained reason that made sense in Gosnell's world. She then spied some silverware. It appeared she was going to have to use the crude method.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina slowly reached across the bar and grabbed the silverware. She decided on a steak knife. She figured that just in case she was wrong, a steak knife would do the least amount of damage to the captain.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">RC was just coming out of the usual shock she felt when her uniform tightened up around the chest. And the pure thought that someone would just throw water in her face kind of shocked her too. RC opened her mouth to start swearing at Gosnell when she felt a poking at her arm.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She turned. Mina, having partially climbed over Raye, was hacking at her arm with a steak knife. It was a very dull steak knife. Mina was putting all her energy into it, but she couldn't even get it to break the skin. The knife blade just bent, and finally snapped off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"AINO! What are you doing?\" RC yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You're a changeling, aren't you?\" Mina screamed back. She turned to Gosnell. \"Hand me that beer bottle.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell, not one to sit idly by when he could help instigate trouble, complied. Mina took the bottle and SMASH right over the top of RC's head. RC screamed. That hurt! Mina also screamed when the blood from the cut she managed to make with the bottle didn't change into changeling goo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh damn.\" Mina moaned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">RC gave Mina the once-over. \"Do that again, and watch what happens.\" She warned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina slithered back to her seat. She decided now she needed to be on her best behavior. Maybe her last boyfriend was right. Maybe she was too suspicious. Naaa. She thought. He just said that to cover up the fact he was cheating on me. Mina nodded her approval to that thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">RC managed to shake off the pain of the beer bottle. She turned to Gosnell. Gosnell wasn't sure if he should be afraid or not.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!\" RC bellowed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell smiled. \"You said 'hit me with a water.' So, there you go.\" Before Ranma could fly across the bar to kill Gosnell, Raye turned to her and grabbed her breast.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ooo! You're cute!\" She said. \"Well built too!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">RC screamed. She was not fond of it when her boobs were manhandled. Except when her doctor did her physicals. He has such soft hands.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">RC started to back away. What was up with this chick? RC tripped as she tried to escape. Raye knew what time it was. She pounced on RC and proceeded to kiss her. Of course, due to RC's patented bad luck, Shampoo and Akane came into the bar at the same time from opposite sides of the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RANMA!\" They both screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">RC was about to try and explain, but the moment she opened her mouth, Raye slipped her tongue in. This of course made Ranma freak out and made Shampoo and Akane, well, freak out in their own way.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two women jumped onto Raye, proceeding to pound the hell out of her. Well, Shampoo was beating Raye, while Akane was beating Ranma. Raye, however, was not one to take this lying down, so she fought back. This ignited a brawl between the three women, leaving RC to be trampled on the bottom of the dogpile.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the people who were dancing near the windows saw the fight.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"FIGHT!\" He screamed. This was the fuse that set off a riot in 10-forward. Everyone in the bar started brawling with each other. Well, almost everyone. Ryouga was just sitting at his table. Alone. Nursing his drink.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina decided that she'd gotten into enough trouble for one day and that it would be best for her not to be included in any of this. She vaulted over the bar and hit the floor. She noticed Gosnell ducking behind the bar as well, screaming into his COM panel.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, Mousse. I said RIOT! Now get your lackeys down here now!\" Gosnell closed the connection and grinned at Mina. \"I must now do my duty and try and stop this fight.\" He started to stand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina grabbed Gosnell's shoulder and began to object. Gosnell placed his index finger to her lips. \"Quiet child. I will be OK.\" He kissed Mina on the forehead and began to stand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sat back, in awe. The man. Gosnell. He was so brave.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell hopped on top of the bar. \"PEOPLE! PEOPLE!\" He bellowed. Everyone stopped fighting and looked at him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Can't we all just get along?\" He pleaded. His cries went unheard as several glasses came flying at his head. Gosnell let out a scream that resembled a seven-year-old girl and dove back behind the bar. He looked to Mina, who somewhat looked disappointed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nice try.\" She comforted. A crewman came flying over the bar, slammed into the wall, and slid to the floor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors to 10-forward hissed open and about 50 of Mousse's security officers came running in, all armed with duck-shaped potty trainers. The security officers immediately went to work beating the rioters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga was starting to get frustrated. How was he supposed to properly wallow in self-pity with all this damn noise? It wasn't till someone's tooth fell in his drink that he snapped.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He hopped up onto his table.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"HEY! SHUT UP!\" He screamed. It was at this time that he received a duck-shaped toilet trainer to the head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ok bitches.\" He grumbled. \"BAK-SI-KEN-TETSU!!\" Ryouga applied the breaking point to the table. As it began to explode, he realized what a horrible mistake he had just made. This table was glass. He screamed. \"DAMN!\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sickbay was the location most of the rioters were at. The others were in the brig, being sobered up. Akane's staff was busy, mostly pulling glass fragments out of various locations.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane got the patient who took the most damage. Ryouga. Normally the breaking point doesn't hurt him, but usually, he does it on rocks. Rocks will bounce off the body. Glass on the other hand will embed itself in a person&rsquo;s skin.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga was lying face down on Akane's exam table. His pants were pulled down to his knees. It seems that all the large pieces of glass ended up stuck in Ryouga's butt. This made Akane very uncomfortable. She was doing her best to remove the fragments without looking at, well, it. His butt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane's embarrassment was nothing though. Nothing compared to what Ryouga felt. There is no color of red to describe what color his face was. This wasn't just because of him being pants down in front of Akane, but also because this was secretly a fantasy of his. Well, minus the horribly painful glass shards.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors to sickbay opened. Ranma walked in. He was all male again. He had finally managed to explain to Shampoo what had happened. That had taken him a while, and Shampoo was the easy one. Now time to work on Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He walked up to where Akane was.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hi?\" Akane just ignored him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RANMA!\" Ryouga screamed. \"THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked around. He didn't see Ryouga anywhere. Did he? He looked at the table. Yikes. Not a sight he wanted to see. He walked around the front of the exam table and squatted. Yup there, with his head hanging over the edge of the table, was Ryouga.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga!\" Ranma chirped. \"You're looking well!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SHUT UP!\" Ryouga yelled back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma chuckled and walked back to Akane. \"Akane. I'm sorry. Even though it wasn't my fault.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane stopped and turned to him. \"It's never your fault, is it?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma missed the sarcasticness in that. \"Usually not.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane just shook her head. \"I have work to do.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma, realizing it was useless at this point to argue further walked off, deciding the bridge is a much friendlier place now.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He walked out the doors of sickbay and up the hallway to the turbo lift. He hit the call button and waited. He was mad. It's been a long time since he was mad like this. He wasn't mad at Akane, at Mina, or even at Raye. He was mad at himself. He felt he was getting slow, even sloppy, lately. There were times when no one could have gotten him the way Gosnell did.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma realized that he has been distracted lately. That and he has become complacent. Ordering people to do things for you is an easy way to get out of the practice of doing things himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma realized that if he was going to have a chance against the Kuno's, he was going to have to work on his mental discipline. If he continued to get distracted it might mean the death of him and his crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He really didn't know what was distracting him though. He hoped he could figure it out before too long. It's hard not to be distracted when you don't know why you're being distracted in the first place.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift hissed open. Mina was in there. He stepped in with her. The doors close.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Bridge,\" Ranma ordered the lift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Computer, pause.\" Mina cut in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain. I'm sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry I tried to stab you with the knife and sorry I hit you with a beer bottle.\" Mina said shyly. It wasn't like her to be this shy, but she really felt stupid for what she did.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander, your intentions were good. Didn't do any real damage and I heal fast.\" Ranma replied. He smiled at her with the old Saotome charm, trying to lift her spirits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina smiled back. The last man she hit with a beer bottle didn't take it so well. But he deserved it. Ranma didn't.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;\"Continue,\" Mina told the computer. She, however, was curious. \"What's up with that whole guy/girl thing?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighed. Just thinking about it hurt his stomach. \"You ever hear of Jusenkyo?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shook her head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's a cursed springs training ground. I fell into the spring of drowned girl. Now whenever I get hit with cold water, I turn into a girl, and hot water reverses the effect.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Gotcha. Is there a cure?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, but it&rsquo;s in China.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh, I see,\" Mina replied. She wasn't sure why the Captain didn't just beam down there and cure himself when they were in orbit around Earth, but she was sure he had his reasons.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift doors opened. Ranma and Mina walked onto the bridge. The first thing they saw was Shampoo and Raye choking each other. Ranma ran over and broke up the fight.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?\" Ranma screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo grabbed a hold of Ranma. \"Stupid girl try to steal Ranma!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye interjected. \"I did not! She's pissed for some reason! She said I kissed her fianc&eacute;e in 10-forward!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma groaned. \"Shampoo. Sit. Raye, don't worry, you didn't.\" Ranma felt the less Raye remembered, the better off he'd be.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors hissed open again. Ryouga came walking, very slowly, out of the turbo lift and down to his station. He placed a pillow on his chair and sat down extremely slowly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain,\" Mina said. \"We're approaching the Finden system.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good, Ensign, slow to impulse, standard orbit over Finden Three.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aye, sir.\" Ryouga groaned. The ship shuddered and slammed to a stop.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sorry,\" Ryouga responded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Engineering to the bridge!\" Serena's voice came over the communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Go ahead, Commander,\" Ranma replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Tell whoever did that not to do it again. That's not good for the clutch or the structural integrity field, or something that has a lot of flashing red lights on it. You know it would be a lot more useful if they'd spend as much money on labels as they did on pointless flashing lights!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Already under control, Serena. Thanks. Saotome out.\" Ranma stood up and walked to Ryouga. \"Did you catch that?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga scowled. \"I said sorry!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked back to his seat. \"Mousse. Do you see anything on the sensors?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse gave the panel a good look. \"No!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo turned to him. \"PUT YOUR GLASSES ON STUPID!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse slid his glasses that were on top of his head over his eyes. \"Oh yeah. Eleven fighter-type ships and one battlecruiser in orbit on the other side of the planet.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma groaned. \"Ryouga, catch up with them and match their orbit. Mousse, hail them.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both officers complied. Mousse was the first to answer. \"The battle cruiser commander is hailing us.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ah, well on screen,\" Ranma answered as he stood.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the main view screen, an older man appeared. He was wearing a suit and tie. He had gray hair. He looked at Ranma and started to laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You want something?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma didn't know why he was laughing. But he wanted to know. \"I am Captain Ranma Saotome of the Federation Starship Sisko. Why are you pestering the people of Finden?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man stopped laughing. \"The Federation, huh? Well, I am Roy Captain Sha'Na Nana. And this planet needs to be taught proper articulation.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This threw the whole bridge crew off. \"What?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We have been monitoring their newscasts. They have mispronounced too many words. For the sake of good journalism, we must step in.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma was a little confused, but he knows what they meant. He's seen Finden newscasts. They did mispronounce quite a few things. Regardless Ranma knew what he needed to do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I understand your intentions, Captain Nana. However, the Federation wants me to ask you to leave.\" Ranma told the old man.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"NO! We will not leave until our work is done! If you don't let us continue, we will destroy you!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma doubted that is possible. He turned to Mousse and signaled for him to mute the transmission. Mousse complied. Ranma turned to Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What are their defensive capabilities?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo looked at her terminal and grinned. \"Silly men had two Xenon Rocket Launchers on each fighter and a low yield plasma cannon on the cruiser. That all. No match.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded to her. He then turned to Raye. \"What do you think?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye sighed. \"They're willing to die for their beliefs. They truly think what they are doing is just.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"All right. Open channel.\" The speakers chirped. \"Captain Nana. We understand what you are trying to do, but this planet is a member of the United Federation of Planets, and you must leave it be. The Federation grants these people certain rights, including the right to misarticulate. I will warn you now, if you don't leave on your own, we will remove you by force.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Captain Nana just about blew a gasket. \"Right to misarticulate? We'll see about that!\" The screen went back to the shot of the Roy ships as Captain Nana closed the channel.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Great. Mousse shields up. Shields. Not a torpedo.\" Ranma ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes sir.\" Mousse replied. The shields buzzed to life.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Outside, the Roy ships assumed an attack posture. They fired. Fourteen rockets came out of the Roy ships. Each rocket hit the Sisko's shields and bounced off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma didn't want to fire on the ships, but what choice did they have? Hopefully, they would get the point after the first shot and buzz off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mousse, target the third ship to the left. Fire one torpedo.\" Ranma ordered. Mousse obeyed. The torpedo fired from the Sisko. It hit the targeted Roy ship. Once the fireball dissipated there was just a small amount of debris.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain,\" Mousse said. \"The Roy Captain is hailing us.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"On screen.\" Ranma grinned at the Roy Captain appeared. He was white with fear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain Saotome. Our work here is done. We will be on our way! Give the Federation our best!\" The screen returned to the external view as the ships warped towards home.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma grinned. \"Good work everyone. That was a job well done-\" Ranma was cut off by a frantic Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"CAPTAIN!!!\" He screamed. \"A SHIP! LONG RANGE SENSORS! AHHHHH!!\" Mousse was slapped very hard by Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"STUPID MOUSSE! GET AHOLD OF SELF! WHAT WRONG?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"A cubical-shaped ship is on an intercept course at warp 9.75.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Cubical shaped?\" Ranma looked confused.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Err &ndash; Cube shaped.\" Mousse replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thank God. I was worried that the people from the planet Dilbert were pissed again-\" Ranma cut himself off when he realized that cube-shaped was much worse than cubical-shaped.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mousse! Can identify?\" Shampoo asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes.\" Mousse whimpered. \"It's Kuno.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone on the bridge gasped.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mina,\" Ranma said. \"Time to intercept?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Two hours, Captain.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Send a priority one message to Starfleet, Mousse. Let them know what's up and request instructions.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo have instruction. Run like hell.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"Ryouga. Set course, 1-7-5 mark 0-1-6. Maximum warp.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga complied. \"Course and speed laid in, sir.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That felt good. Ryouga just called him sir. He'd been looking forward to this day for a very, very long time. It made Ranma feel that he had finally won their 'battle.' Ranma was king. King of the world!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"CAPTAIN!\" Shampoo screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT?! Oh yeah, Engage!\" Ranma chuckled nervously. Again with the distractions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ship turned about-face and shot off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain,\" Mina spoke up. Ranma knew this was bad news. The Ops officer rarely spoke unless spoken to unless it was bad news. \"At our current speed, the Kuno cube will still overtake us in four hours.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma hit his communicator. \"Engineering! Serena, can we get any more speed?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena got up from the terminal she was playing computer solitaire on.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'll see what I can do, Captain. Engineering out.\" Serena walked to the middle of engineering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"OK PEOPLE! We need to get more speed!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"But Commander!\" One of the engineering crew complained. \"We're already going warp 9.55!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena screamed. \"THAT'S FAST!!\" She sat back down. \"Well, the captain said we need more, so give us more!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She was responded to with several 'yes ma&rsquo;ams. She whimpered for a bit, but then stood up. I'm going to show that Raye, she thought. I am going to show here that I can be a good officer. I'll show here that I am not a klutz! Serena looked around. Which one is the engine computer? Serena noticed that most of the crewmen were standing around one particular station. Serena ran over to help her crew on the warp engine, but she tripped on her hair and fell to her face.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; text-align: justify;\">\"WAAAAAAA!\"<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7114a914-7fff-f3e2-144c-26a63b1c12b2\"></span></p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "dude-looks-like-a-lady", "story": 1}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 4, "fields": {"chapter_number": 3, "title": "Some Things Were Just Never Meant To Be", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane sat back in her office chair. She loved this chair. It was so big and comfy. Much better than any other chair. When they designed these new ships they took into account comfort that was for sure.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane took a sip of her coffee. She never really drank coffee until she started getting supervisor positions. Seems that if you are a supervisor, coffee is a requirement. That and cigarettes. The only problem with cigarettes is that it's hard to find a place on the ship that you can smoke without setting off some kind of alarm. Either a fire alarm or a smoke alarm. The redundancy of that made Akane's head hurt. Obviously, if there is smoke there is fire and vice versa. Why have two separate alarms for people to monitor?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luckily she figured out a trick. All she had to do was call security and tell them that she was running an open flame experiment and they would shut down the alarm sensors for sickbay. Being in charge had its perks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"God, now that I am thinking about them, I am going to have to have one!\" She complained to herself. She pulled out her pack of Camel Turkish Gold and made the call to security. She then lit one up, using her plasma torch she stole from engineering, took a big drag, leaned back and &ndash;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">HISS. The doors to sickbay shot open and scared her. She fell back on her butt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane?\" Ranma called.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah &ndash; yeah I'm in here.\" Akane shot back, quickly putting her cigarette out in her petri dish ashtray.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walks into Akane's office. He looks around and takes a sniff.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I thought you quit?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Quit what?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane, you can't fool me. Give them here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane pulls the pack out of her pocket and tosses it to Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How'd you get a uniform with pockets?\" Ranma complained.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane ignored that comment. You have to be special to get pockets. \"You know Ranma,\" Akane grinned. \"I think if you can make out with girls on the floor of 10-Forward, I think I should be able to smoke.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now just a&mdash;\" Ranma cuts himself off. Did Akane just make a joke? Ranma starts to laugh. \"That was funny and fair.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma tosses the cigarettes back to Akane. \"The thing in 10-Forward probably won't happen again.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane laughs. \"Yes, it will. You're a pervert!\" Akane winds up and POW! Right out the door, Ranma flies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sits up. No matter what I do, I can't seem to make her happy. Maybe I should just tell her I want to cancel the engagement. I mean, I'm a starship captain. I shouldn't have my CMO hitting me and stuff. It's pretty obvious that it was never meant to be.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's determined then. Assuming we survive.\" Ranma nods to himself. Ranma pauses. He shakes his head and walks on. She can't be it, can she?</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aboard the dark, gray cube-shaped Kuno ship, Principal Kuno paces the corridors. His mind was full of thoughts. Not just his, but of course the rest of the Kuno collective. It was driving him nuts.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, there were the thoughts of Tatewaki. He wanted to beat that boy. All he thought about constantly was himself, Akane Tendo, and the Pig-Tailed Girl. The principal even found himself waking up in the middle of the night screaming 'I SHALL DATE WITH YOU!' Nothing will scare a drone more than shouting that as he's walking by.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next, there was Kodachi. She was a twisted, twisted girl. The only dreams she ever had were dreams of her and Ranma Saotome &ndash; well, being friendly. Principal Kuno wanted to hurl. But it did raise a question, but seeing Ranma naked to verify probably wouldn't happen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then there is George Kuno. He was adopted. It was painfully obvious of that too. For one he was sane. Well, sort of. For two, he was black. He was very smart and very, very evil. So evil that he almost scared the Principal. And that was hard to do, considering he was considered the quadrant's second evilest being. Only the Rosie O'Donnell clone was eviler, according to Neilson Evil Research.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Dad?\" The principal turned around. It was George.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, son?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"When we catch the Starfleet ship, can I keep Shampoo's eyes? They are very pretty. I'd like to put them on my desk with my beanie babies.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Principal Kuno shuddered a little. \"Sure son. Whatever you'd like. But that means you will have to capture her before we destroy the ship. And where, may I ask, did you get a desk?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I will do that, father. I will make you proud of me. And I built it myself with the spare parts I found in the assimilation repository.\" George walked off and starts laughing like a mad man. The principal walks over to his chair and takes a seat. That's weird. The only thing in that repository is leftover body parts. What could he have made the desk &ndash; Oh my.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly black rose petals filled the hallway. The principal groaned to himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Greetings father! I, Kodachi Kuno, the black rose of the Alpha Quadrant, say good morning to you!\" Kodachi spins around a few times and sits next to her father.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hi, Kodachi.\" The principal grumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So when we get to them we are going to beam Ranma over here to me and then blow up the ship with the wretched Akane Tendo?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sure.\" The principal said, somewhat unenthusiastically. He could remember when he used to enjoy blowing up ships and their crews, but lately, it's seemed more like a job than it did fun. Seems to have started after he brought his family into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"DESTROY NOT AKANE TENDO OR THE PIG TAILED GIRL!\" Tatewaki screamed from the other side of the room. The minute he heard the thought of Akane or The Pig-Tailed Girl being destroyed he leaped from his regeneration chamber and ran as fast as he could up to where his sister was. Bokken in hand, he is ready to fight his sister for the life of Akane and Female Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Brother dearest, if you think that you can defeat me, you are SADLY mistaken.\" Kodachi grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now now &ndash; my kiki shouldn't fight like this. We all need to be bruddahs and sistas in this endeavor. If we fight we cannot take ova the galaxy!\" Principal Kuno got up and stepped between the two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno lowered his bokken and Kodachi her rhythmic gymnastic tools. Principal Kuno smiles and sits back down. Kuno walks past his sister, but as he does he lays in a few passing words.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane Tendo and the Pig-Tailed Girl will not be touched.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi just grins. \"Neither will my love Ranma.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two laugh maniacally and walk off. The Principal can just sit. Sit and cry.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The area where Ranma was pacing could easily be seen in the rug. It looked as if he had been pacing for years, but it had only been about 20 minutes. He was very worried. The Kuno ship will overtake them in a little over three hours, and when they did it would not be pretty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Engineering had gotten the ship up to Warp 9.77, but the Kuno ship had increased to 9.95. Even if they could get the ship to 9.95, the Kuno's could maintain that speed for a longer amount of time, and therefore still overtake them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma had a plan though. Sort of. If we get to a place where we would have a tactical advantage, then we will be okay. Maybe. But then again something always comes up and disrupts my plans.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ranma?\" Shampoo was starting to worry about Ranma. He had been pacing ever since he got back from sickbay. \"Ranma okay?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stops and looks at Shampoo. \"Yeah &ndash; I am okay. Just worried you know.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ranma have nothing to worry about. Shampoo here.\" Shampoo smiled big when she said that.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, I guess that does make it all better.\" Ranma slumped down into his seat. As he slumped down farther, Ranma closed his eyes. He remembers when life was so easy. He was just a lowly ensign on a transport ship. At first, he didn't like the idea of taking orders from people, but he soon realized that it had its benefits.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you take orders your responsibility level plummets. If anything ever went wrong all he had to do was say 'I was just following orders'. That fixed just about any problem. It could also be a nasty catch 22 as well. If all you did was follow orders and never do anything on your own, you will never go anywhere. Ranma had the nice quality of being able to do both. This had helped him hit Captain so fast. How his father got to be an admiral was beyond him though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain?\" Mousse peeped.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, Lieutenant?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We are being hailed by Ambassador Soun Tendo.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ambassador? Good grief, what has happened to the galaxy?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Put it on screen.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The viewscreen blinked to life and Soun Tendo appeared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RANMA!!!!!!!!\" Soun bellowed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What could I have possibly done now?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ranma!

What's the problem?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"PIRATES!\" Soun screamed and then began running around in circles on the view screen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Pirates? Which pirates? The Ferengi? The Pirates of the Caribbean? The Pittsburgh Pirates?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SPACE PIRATES!!!!!!!!\" Soun began to bawl now.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked to Shampoo who just shrugged. Mina turned around. \"Sir, I have heard that a group calling themselves 'Space Pirates' have been attacking small colonies and taking their beer.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ambassador Tendo &ndash; where are you at right now?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm in the basement hiding.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo almost giggles, but a stern look from Ranma stops her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What planet are you on?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"California V\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay &ndash; We will head that way and assist.\" Ranma signals for Mousse to kill the link.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What about Kunos?\" Shampoo asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We will deal with them later. Right now we have to go and take care of these pirates.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo nods and stands up. \"Ryouga! Change course 4-4-4 mark 1-6! Current speed! ENGAGE!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga, who is still sitting a little awkwardly, obliges. The ship slams to a stop. Everyone on the bridge goes flying forward.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga's eyes get wide. \"Whoops.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo manages to scrape herself off the viewscreen. She then walks up to Ryouga with a small hammer and smacks him in the head. \"WHOOPS?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"OW! Sorry yeah just hit the emergency stop button instead of the engage button.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye looks to Mina. \"And he couldn't figure that out in space dock?\" Mina simply floats a shrug.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How you do that stupid?\" Shampoo bellowed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don't call me stupid. It's a simple mistake. They start with the same letter.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo tosses the hammer and goes for her phaser. Ranma runs over and grabs her arm and drags her back to her seat.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "some-things-were-just-never-meant-to-be", "story": 1}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 5, "fields": {"chapter_number": 4, "title": "Not All Pirates Have Parrots", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Arr!

It was his XO, Commander Lita Kino. &ldquo;Do you want the stardate or the real date?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I want a date, beautiful!&rdquo; Brian grinned back</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Brian&rsquo;s grin was immediately met with a shoe to the mouth. The shoe still happened to be on Lita&rsquo;s foot, so it made contact very hard. &ldquo;You got a girl.&rdquo; She grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;UmmmHmmm &ndash;&ldquo; Brian murmured. &ldquo;The real date will work fine.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;April 7th, 2388.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Brian replied. He spun in his chair and started his log entry again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Captain&rsquo;s Log &ndash; April 7th, 2388. Having dropped our taxes at the post office with 8 days to spare, we have decided to do some plundering.&nbsp; What better place to do it than California V. A planet of pacifists. Hopefully, these hippies will have plenty of beer and money for us.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; One of the no-name officers on the bridge yells.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;A Federation starship has just done a U-iey and is on an intercept course!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Uh oh.&rdquo; Lita mumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;No no no!&rdquo; Brian hops up from his chair and walks over to Lita. &ldquo;Uh oh was last month when we had that old Ferengi rat trap! We have a powerful ship now &ndash; and a cloaking device!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Oh yeah!&rdquo; Lita grins. &ldquo;Ensign! E-T-A of the ship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Twenty-eight minutes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Good. Get all the specs on the ship and tell the away team that they only have twenty minutes of plundering left.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lita walks over to the view screen and looks down on the planet. Brian comes up behind her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;You know &ndash;&ldquo; Brian starts. &ldquo;We could get a lot done in twenty minutes.&rdquo; Brian rubs Lita&rsquo;s butt. Lita starts to laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Yes, we could.&rdquo; She turns around and WHAM &ndash; sends Brian flying across the bridge. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want you to get hurt.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Brian remains on the ground and laughs. &ldquo;Hahaha Federation! Try your best!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Sir &ndash;&ldquo; The no-name perks up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Both Brian and Lita answer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gosnell class.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Uh oh.&rdquo; Both Brian and Lita murmur.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;As soon as the away team is on board engage the cloak,&rdquo; Lita ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Brian managed to drag himself back up to his chair. &ldquo;Tell them to hurry, but remind them that they will be shot out an airlock if they don&rsquo;t bring me a lot of Captain Morgan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lita didn&rsquo;t care for the fact that he was an alcoholic, but he seemed to handle it okay. So for the most part she didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;SIR!&rdquo; The no-name screams this time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;WHAT WHAT WHAT? Can&rsquo;t you freakin&rsquo; tell me everything at once? Is that so damned hard?&rdquo; Brian screamed back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. More dramatic this way! Regardless, there is a Kuno ship on an intercept course with the Federation ship!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s just swell,&rdquo; Brian murmured.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Down on the planet, the capital city of Mountain Doo (no copyright infringement here) was being ransacked by the Captain&rsquo;s chief ransacker, and current girlfriend, Be&rsquo;Yach. Be&rsquo;Yach was one-quarter Klingon, but she was a hottie. This is why the Captain made her the chief ransacker. Her looks often distract local police which allows the ransacking team to do its pillaging.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the Federation Embassy, Soun Tendo is sitting in the corner along with Admiral Genma Saotome. Genma had decided to drop by to play some games with Soun in an attempt to avoid Ranma. However, he was starting to realize that this might not have been the best idea he has ever had. Not only was the colony being ransacked, but Ranma would also be there shortly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the two of them were riding out the attack, they decided to get a few games of Go in. As usual, Soun was beating the pants off of Genma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;When is that ingrate son of mine going to get here?&rdquo; Genma grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The people working the communications device said that they should be here within fifteen minutes,&rdquo; Soun replied. &ldquo;Gotcha.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Soun moved his piece and it drove Genma nuts.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;THIS IS NO TIME TO BE PLAYING GAMES!&rdquo; Genma screams, knocking the board over.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never a good time when you are losing is it.&rdquo; Soun glared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Now, now &ndash; &ldquo; Genma said, backing away from an angry Soun. &ldquo;- Now is no time for fighting between friends.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Soun stopped and thought about this for a second. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We will settle this after the raid.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Genma nodded when a large explosion broke up his nodding very close to the building.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo; Genma yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An ensign working in the embassy began checking screens. &ldquo;It appears the pirate ship is firing plasma charges at us!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They have never done anything that would actually kill anyone before.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Outside of the building, Be&rsquo;Yach, who was sent head over heels from an explosion missing her and her group by less than 20 meters, is making an attempt to regain her senses. &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; She pulls her communicator out of her pocket and opens a channel.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is the MGD Mad Dog here.&rdquo; Lita&rsquo;s voice is heard over the comm line. In the background, you can hear red alert sirens blaring.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;This is Be&rsquo;Yach! What the hell are you doing?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We and the planet are being attacked by the Kunos!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What about the Federation ship?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! They changed directions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ONBOARD THE SISKO</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Ryouga!&rdquo; Ranma screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened. I didn&rsquo;t touch anything!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ranma started to pace again. They were lost. Lost in space. Ryouga was right though. He didn&rsquo;t touch anything. It must just have been his aura. It caused the ship to start making course corrections. And now they were lost. At least the Kuno&rsquo;s had stopped pursuing them. Unfortunately, they continued onto the planet that Soun was on.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; Mousse screamed. &ldquo;They are attacking the planet!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ranma growls. &ldquo;Ryouga &ndash; get us there A-S-A-P!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ryouga nods. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; He leans to Mina. &ldquo;Can you do it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">BACK ON THE PLANET</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Be&rsquo;Yach takes off running towards the Embassy. Five of her lackeys are trailing behind her. One of them stops.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go in there!&rdquo; He exclaims. &ldquo;The Federation will arrest us!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Suddenly a plasma charge hits a nearby building, causing it to fall inches from the frightened lackey.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Well, I guess being in a jail would be better than being out here, eh?&rdquo; The lackey decides to run in behind his boss and fellow lackeys.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the door, there are two Federation Police Officers standing. One moves to block the entrance to the door.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I have to let you know that if you enter this building you will be arrested and severely beaten.&rdquo; The officer says.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Whatever!&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach yells. &ldquo;Just let us the hell in!&rdquo; The guard steps to the side. Be&rsquo;Yach and the lackeys bolt through the door and down into the basement where Soun and Genma are. One of the officers that were in the basement sees them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;&ldquo;ADMIRAL! PIRATES!&rdquo; He yells. Genma turns around and sees the pirates.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Stay back! I&rsquo;ll shoot you!&rdquo; Genma screams. Soun leans forward and begins to whisper in his ear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Saotome &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have a phaser.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;So I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Genma replies. They both start to laugh hysterically. Be&rsquo;Yach just looks at the others.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; &ldquo; Be&rsquo;Yach explains. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to hurt you. Well, not anymore. We just want to hide here till the attack stops.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Soun comes forward. &ldquo;So, you aren&rsquo;t responsible for the attack?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Be&rsquo;Yach shakes her head. &ldquo;No. The Kunos are in orbit. They attacked our ship and it was forced to flee. Last I heard though there was a Gosnell class ship en route.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;RANMA!!&rdquo; Genma cheers. &ldquo;He will come and rescue me!&rdquo; Soun glares at him. &ldquo;Us. I said us!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; One of the ensigns pipes up. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we take them into custody?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Soun declares. &ldquo;They have learned their lesson I am sure. Forgive and forget is the Anything Goes motto!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Says everyone, except of course Genma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Thank you, Ambassador.&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach bows.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Several more explosions are heard in quick succession. Then they suddenly stop.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Is it over?&rdquo; Genma asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Comm panel chirps to life. Mousse&rsquo;s voice is heard. &ldquo;Sisko to Embassy. Stand by &ndash; we are engaging the Kunos.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The bridge of the Sisko was lit with only the dark blue lights that set the mood when there was a battle, the red flashing alert lights, and the light coming from the crew&rsquo;s consoles. Ranma was sitting in his chair, legs crossed. He loved battle. Exploration didn&rsquo;t really suit him. He was in it for the fight.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shampoo was standing behind Mousse. Normally this would put Mousse into a coma, but during battles, he seemed very intense and into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ryouga was sitting very still, mostly because if he moved much it would send a shooting pain through his ass. He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure that Akane had gotten all the glass out, but he really didn&rsquo;t want to go back to sickbay for another session of pluck the butt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mina was ready for anything. She had her panel set up so that she could take over anyone&rsquo;s console and do their job. She needed to be ready for that for the simple fact that the slightest hit could make someone&rsquo;s panel explode. Except hers. They made the science officer&rsquo;s console out of material that wouldn&rsquo;t explode. Why they didn&rsquo;t do that with all the other ones was beyond her, but that wasn&rsquo;t important right now. What was important is that she stayed focused.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Mousse,&rdquo; Ranma said, standing up. &ldquo;Open a channel to the Kuno ship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aye, sir.&rdquo; The Comm beeped and Principal Kuno appeared on the viewscreen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aloha!&rdquo; The principal said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Principal Kuno. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Why destroying the planet!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ranma hated this guy and his cockiness. His whole damn family was like this. Nothing worse than cockiness. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t destroy them. We will destroy you first. We are better than you and you know it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Oh &ndash; we see about that pig-tailed boy!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The screen clicked back to the external view. The Kuno ship swung around and came towards them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Fire quantum torpedoes!&rdquo; Ranma yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Sisko shot out a round of blue torpedoes from the front of the ship. They all directly hit the Kuno ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ONBOARD THE KUNO SHIP</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Oh, they got dem mean weapons!&rdquo; The principal screamed, dodging the steam that was shooting out of the wall. The principal was in no way ready for that kind of impact. They had only dealt with the Federation when they had photon torpedoes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tatewaki comes screaming down the hallway. &ldquo;ON GUARD FATHER! HOW DARE YOU FIRE UPON AKANE TENDO!&rdquo; The principal just rolled his eyes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;In case you being blind, they be the ones firing on us!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tatewaki looks at all the damaged parts hanging off the walls. He turns to his father and reattaches his bokken to his belt. &ldquo;Fair enough father. It seems the cretinous Saotome has defiled the great cube of Kuno. We shall smite the!&rdquo; Kuno begins to cackle and presses some buttons.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Multiple torpedoes fire out of the Kuno ship and create a fierce glowing when they come in contact with the shields of the Sisko.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ONBOARD THE SISKO</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The impact sends everyone sailing. Most people take it in stride. Except for Ryouga. He slides right out of his chair and onto the ground. Landing on his butt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;OWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!&rdquo; Ryouga screams. He taps his communicator. &ldquo;Hibiki to transporter room! One to beam directly to sickbay!&rdquo; The familiar sounds are heard and Ryouga vanishes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;RYOUGA! DAMN IT!&rdquo; Ranma screams. &ldquo;SHAMPOO TAKE HELM!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shampoo vaults over the tactical console and sits in Ryouga&rsquo;s seat. She begins to bring the ship about and into a defensive position.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; Mousse cheers. Shampoo just turns and gives him her patented glare.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Mousse &ndash; Full volley of quantum torpedoes, followed by two volleys of photon torpedoes! Aim to kill.&rdquo; Ranma ordered, sitting back into his chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Bwa haha! Aye, sir!&rdquo; Mousse said. Even though they fought a lot, Mousse had learned to respect Ranma in battle. He made a good enemy, but an even better ally.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the front of the ship, the spread of quantum torpedoes shot out at an incredible rate. The explosion that they caused was even more incredible. Then the photon torpedoes followed. About 10 of them. All impacting where the quantum torpedoes did. It turned the Kuno cube into what more resembled a triangle.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ONBOARD THE KUNO SHIP</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Principal Kuno&rsquo;s many years in space had taught him a valuable lesson. You gotta know when to hold em, know when to fold em, know when to walk away, and know when to run. This was the time for the latter. The principal turned the ship around and shot out of there at warp 9.99. Kodachi comes running up to her father.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;DADDY! Turn around! We need to rescue my darling Ranma from Akane Tendo!&rdquo; She whined. The principal just glared at her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nuts. We ain&rsquo;t going back there till will make some repairs and adjustment!&rdquo; He explained.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kodachi began to pout and then finally bounded away in a flurry of black rose pedals. The principal just groaned, put his head in his hands, and began to cry. &ldquo;Why me?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ONCE AGAIN ON THE SISKO</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; Mina gasped. &ldquo;Look at all the debris!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone just stared at the viewscreen. The part of the Kuno ship that they had blown off was just floating there. In many, many pieces.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Shampoo never see Kuno defeated so fast!&rdquo; Shampoo said as she got up from the help station. &ldquo;Mousse! Stand down from red alert!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Aye aye buttercup!&rdquo; Mousse obliged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ranma just sat in his chair lost in thought. He didn&rsquo;t even acknowledge Shampoo vaulting over him to attack Mousse. He couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out why the Kuno&rsquo;s were so easy to beat. Could it actually be that Starfleet developed a useful weapon?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Captain?&rdquo; Mina called.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ranma was still lost in thought and didn&rsquo;t notice her. Until he was shaken to his senses by a plasma charge, that is.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;WHAT THE &ndash;&ldquo; He screamed. He looked to the view screen. Shampoo climbed off of Mousse and looked up. What appeared to be a Klingon Bird-of-Prey was sitting right in front of them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Klingons?&rdquo; Shampoo mumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mina began to shake her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t read any Klingon life signs on the ship. Just human.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That&rsquo;s odd. Thought Ranma. What kind of humans would be on a Bird-of-Prey?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;PIRATES!&rdquo; Ryouga screamed, hobbling off the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Welcome back,&rdquo; Ranma grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;No time for that now!&rdquo; Ryouga panted, running down to his station. &ldquo;Them are pirates!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Shit! Shields up then!&rdquo; Ranma screamed. It was too late though. Another shot was fired at the ship. The shot rocked the ship hard. One of the aft panels exploded and the lights went out. A familiar sound was heard, then the pirate ship recloaked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was some murmuring, and then some of the lights came back on. Ranma peeled himself off the floor and back into his seat. &ldquo;Arrgh. Mousse, status report.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;MULTIPLE DECKS DAMAGED! MULTIPLE HULL BREACHES!&rdquo; Mousse screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Okay! Bridge to sickbay! Report!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A male&rsquo;s voice is heard. &ldquo;Lots of injuries, but so far none serious!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Understood. But where is Akane?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Dr. Tendo &ndash;&ldquo; This caused Ranma to groan. &ldquo;- is not here! She disappeared after the lights went out!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ranma looked behind him. &ldquo;Shampoo check for &ndash;&ldquo; Ranma suddenly realized that Shampoo wasn&rsquo;t back there. He looked around the bridge. Mina, Ryouga, Mousse, a couple of extras &ndash; no Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Mousse! Check for missing &ndash;&ldquo; Ranma was cut off by Mousse&rsquo;s bawling.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;MY SHAMPOOOOOOOOOOOO!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Okay then, Mina &ndash; run a check for missing crew members,&rdquo; Ranma said, standing up and looking at Mina&rsquo;s panel. After a few blips, the display showed that there were four crewmembers missing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Mina, do a roll call. I want everyone accounted for.&rdquo; Mina nodded her acknowledgment. A few moments her display changed to just four names.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The missing crew members are Commander Akane Tendo, Commander Shampoo &ndash;&ldquo; Mina paused for a few seconds and then continued to read the list. &ldquo;Lt. Commander Serena Tskino and Lt. Commander Raye Hino.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ranma put his hand on Mina&rsquo;s shoulder to comfort her. &ldquo;Run a scan for bodies outside of the breeches.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mina nods and runs the scan. &ldquo;None.&rdquo; She runs another scan real quick. &ldquo;I did think I heard a familiar sound and &ndash; yes I am right! There is a transporter trace right over there behind Mousse! Where Shampoo was standing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;THE PIRATES STOLE MY BEAUTIFUL LOVE SLAVE SHAMPOO?!&rdquo; Mousse screams. He begins punching buttons on his panel but it blacks out on him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Suddenly Ranma&rsquo;s chair explodes. Everyone dodges the debris, but the subsequent fire sets off the sprinklers. Soon the cold fire putting out water douses everyone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">RC can just stand there. &ldquo;Why me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mousse flies up onto his console. &ldquo;QUACK!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ryouga just sits in his seat. &ldquo;BWEEEEEEEEEE!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mina can only gasp, and reach for the steak knife that she stashed under her panel.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "not-all-pirates-have-parrots", "story": 1}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 6, "fields": {"chapter_number": 5, "title": "A Change In Tone", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Admiral&rsquo;s log.

Soun had gotten used to warm beds and friendly embassies as Ambassador. You weren&rsquo;t supposed to take an ambassador hostage! You just weren&rsquo;t! Soun made a point to file a complaint when he got rescued.

The Captain will come and rescue us!&rdquo; Raye finished with a smile.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena stops crying. &ldquo;He will? Just like Darien?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye&rsquo;s smile disappears. &ldquo;No &ndash; not like Darien.

Akane gets back up and walks to the force field keeping them locked up.

A man wearing jeans and a Grateful Dead T-shirt walks over to them.

Brian stays to talk to the girls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Who is the senior officer here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo gets up and walks forward. &ldquo;Shampoo is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian looks at all the girls. &ldquo;Which one is Shampoo?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I Shampoo stupid!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian raises an eyebrow. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty hot yourself! Regardless, you are all my prisoners. And it&rsquo;s going to take a lot of gold-pressed Latium to get you four released.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian motions for the guards. They come over, drop the force shield and grab Shampoo. She starts to resist until Brian pulls out his sidearm and points it at Serena.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Come on. Fight us so I have an excuse to waste one of your friends.&rdquo; Brian grins. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like having prisoners and if you want to give me a reason to get rid of one of them now, feel free.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though it isn&rsquo;t in Shampoo&rsquo;s nature, she stops fighting and cooperates.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guards drag Shampoo off. Brian walks over to where Be&rsquo;Yach is taunting Soun and Genma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Hahaha! Baby, can you believe that these idiots told the guards to not arrest us because we had learned our lesson?&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach lets out a hardy laugh for that one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yeah &ndash; why wouldn&rsquo;t you be able to trust a pirate?&rdquo; Brian asks before he falls to the floor laughing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma, who is already pissed from being woken up from his nap, has had just about enough of that. He stands up and walks over toward the force shield.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Now listen just a damned minute!&rdquo; Genma yelled. &ldquo;I am an admiral! You will treat me with some respect!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach and Brian look at each other. Be&rsquo;Yach lowers the force field, and Brian steps in. He walks over to Genma, who is now cowering in the corner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You want respect, old man?&rdquo; Genma just weakly nods. &ldquo;Some R-E-S-P-E-C-T? Want me to tell you what it means to me? Here&rsquo;s some respect for you!&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach hands Brian a big bucket of water with ice cubes in it. &ldquo;Coldwater torture!&rdquo; Brian splashes the water on Genma, and then screams when sitting in front of him is this huge panda.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WHAT THE F-&ldquo; Brain screams, turning and running for the exit. Be&rsquo;Yach, in a total state of shock, hurries to raise the force shield, but mistakenly does it before Brian is out of the cell.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">ZAP!!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That is all that is heard when Brian slams into the force field at full running force. Then a scream is heard. &ldquo;LET ME OUT LET ME OUT!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach manages to drop the force field and let Brian out. She then raises the shield. Then the two go running from the holding cell area. All the while, GenmaPanda (GP) remains cowering in the corner. Soun on the other hand has moved from the other corner to the middle of the cell and begins to sob.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Dad?&rdquo; A voice is heard from the cell next door. Soun&rsquo;s ears perked up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Akane?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Dad! What are you doing in there?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soun runs over and comes as close to the force shield as he can without being zapped. &ldquo;Daddy was kidnapped by the pirates! Saotome is over here too!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Dad we&rsquo;re working on a way to escape. Just sit tight. We know for sure that Ranma is trying to rescue us as well!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soun goes back to the bench in the back of the cell. He sits down. He begins to sob into his hands. He feels a furry paw touch his shoulder. He looks up and sees GP standing there with his portable Go board. Soun smiles. &ldquo;Game on!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian was pissed. He didn&rsquo;t get scared very often. Before this, the last thing that had scared him was the nude Bea Arthur pictures that he had accidentally plundered. Other than that, and the occasional alcohol prohibition that the Federation all too often tried to implement, nothing scared him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Except for pandas.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian knew exactly where his fear of pandas came from. Unlike most phobias that are formed from a traumatic experience at a young age, Brian&rsquo;s experience happened just last year.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>FLASHBACK TIME! WHOO HOO! LOCATION: CHINA LAND RESORT. (A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF THE COMMUNIST PLANETS OF DISNEY/AOL/TIME WARNER.)</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The captain and Be&rsquo;Yach are enjoying their vacation. The resort was very clean and state-run. The fifteen heavily armed police officers monitoring the park gave the two a wonderful sense of security. The lack of an extradition treaty that Disney/AOL/Time Warner had with the Federation also helped. Yes, this was turning out to be the most perfect vacation. Who says communism is all bad?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, the increased sense of security and the feelings of bliss the two had dulled their senses for trouble. Neither of them could feel the pair of beady eyes peering at them through the bushes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;More potato salad my love?&rdquo; Brian asked the cooing Be&rsquo;Yach.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;DID SOMEONE SAY COUP?&rdquo; One of the guards screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian and Be&rsquo;Yach both casually pointed to an overweight, yet still incredibly sexy man sitting behind a computer. The man screamed as the guards rushed him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;M JUST TRYING TO WRITE A GODDAMNED FANFIC!&rdquo; The man screamed as he bolted towards the woods, with all the cops in hot pursuit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;M NOT VERY TALENTED AND YOU GUYS AREN&rsquo;T HELPING! OW!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love some, Hunny bunny!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian fed his girlfriend a sporkful of the yummy store-bought potato salad. Suddenly out of the bushes a very large, and very angry-looking panda stomped out. &ldquo;Panda want potato salad.&rdquo; It growled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach just grinned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. The guards will get him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian returned the smile, turned to call for the guards, and then realized that they had all taken off after the brilliant, yet misunderstood writer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian stood. He knew that he was going to have to defend the very expensive potato salad. This wasn&rsquo;t just KFC potato salad. This was the good stuff. The kind that they only keep in the back room of the local Jewel/Osco. Brian used most of his favors that the Jewel people owed him from when he was produce manager.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach cleared her throat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oh yeah. He remembered. Gotta defend Be&rsquo;Yach too.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian took up a fighting stance. The panda did too. Brian now more than ever hated the fact that weapons were banned at the resort. He really hated the body cavity search that he had to endure too.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The captain took a swing at the panda. The panda easily and effortlessly avoided the swing. It would seem that the panda was well versed in hand-to-paw combat. The fuzzy combatant took a swing back at Brian. Brian had a little bit harder time avoiding that swing than the panda did. Brian was practically useless in hand-to-hand combat. In fact, he lost his balance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The panda moved in. He shoved Brian&rsquo;s back, knocking him onto his hands and knees. The panda then began to do the most unthinkable thing that a panda can do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach can only stare bug-eyed, as her man is dry-humped by the panda. (Yes, Brian was still clothed. Don&rsquo;t be hentai.)</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The panda is really into it. You could tell he&rsquo;s done this kind of thing before. He slaps Brian&rsquo;s ass and lets out a growl.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;GROWL! Who&rsquo;s your daddy bitch? Whose potato salad is it? Show me some respect, and show me what it means to me!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian, who is bawling, attempts to reply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my daddy!! It&rsquo;s your potato salad!! R-E-S-P-E-C-T!!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The panda stops his violation, climbs off his victim, and picks up the potato salad. He turns to Be&rsquo;Yach. &ldquo;Be nice to my bitch. Make sure he calls.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The panda kicks some dirt onto Be&rsquo;Yach and walks back into the bushes with his bounty. Be&rsquo;Yach crawls over to Brian, who is still crying and still in the position the panda left him in. Be&rsquo;Yach pulls out her communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Be&rsquo;Yach to the Jose Cuervo. Two to beam directly to sick-bay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The transporter beam grabs them just as the police officers return, dragging the obviously persecuted writer behind them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; One of the officers bellowed. &ldquo;They left some potato salad!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A low grumbling growl is heard from the bushes.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the flashback ends, Brian allows his head to slam onto his desk. He resumes his crying.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Hun?&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach calls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian slowly lifts his head back up. The depression from the flashback and the fact that the console was made out of metal put him in a state of sadness. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Lita has the prisoner ready for &ndash;&ldquo; Be&rsquo;Yach cuts herself off, noticing Brian&rsquo;s puffy eyes. &ldquo;The panda?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You want we should abandon him somewhere?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll see to it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian hugs Be&rsquo;Yach. Brian wasn&rsquo;t usually very emotional or affectionate aboard the ship where others could see him, but the thing with the panda on the planet, and now in the brig was starting to really get to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;As I was saying. Lita has the prisoner ready for interrogation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brain sighed and nodded. Taking prisoners wasn&rsquo;t really his thing. Wasn&rsquo;t his gas. Wasn&rsquo;t what he liked to do. He was more into it for the plundering. Brian never really wanted to hurt people. He just wanted to get rich. Sometimes the two go hand in hand, so Brian hired Lita to do the dirty work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian chuckled to himself. He remembered how he had to delete Lita&rsquo;s transporter access because she would end up always taking prisoners when he wasn&rsquo;t looking.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since he got that to stop she&rsquo;s been pretty well behaved. When they did take prisoners he had to watch her. She had the nasty habit of, well, killing them. But, Brian knew that in her heart, she was a kind person.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He remembered back to when they first met. She had almost killed him because he had 13 items in the 12 item express lane. Brian knew that she would be very useful. Since then the two had become good friends.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;HEY CAPTAIN DUMBASS! YOU WANT I SHOULD START WITHOUT YOU?&rdquo; Lita screamed, over the familiar sound of a charging phase rifle.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No, No, sweetie.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes toward Be&rsquo;Yach who just giggled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-coming.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian trekked into the room that the Klingons used for interrogation. He loved his girlfriend dearly, but her people were a fucked up race.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The room was dark, with one bright light in the center. Under the light is the interrogation chair. The chair was made of metal, like everything else on the ship. The chair had the capability of becoming a table, for the really icky interrogations.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Strapped to the chair was Shampoo. She had been stripped down to her underwear. The girl was doing her damnedest to hold a straight face, but it was painfully obvious that she wanted to cry. She had bruises all over her body. She also had what appeared to be electrodes attached to her bare stomach and her neck. The area around them was black and blue. Apparently, Lita HAD started without Brian.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing in Shampoo&rsquo;s years with Starfleet had prepared her for this. Of course, there were capture survival classes. But the cushy simulations that the Federation used were nothing like the real thing. She couldn&rsquo;t think anything could be like really being captured.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing that really astonished her that the girl doing the interrogation looked human. She couldn&rsquo;t imagine how one human could do this to another. Shampoo had no problem with a revenge killing or two, but torture? It was unheard of in the 24th century.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Lita said after the door had closed. Her tone was much calmer than it was just a moment ago when she snapped on Brian. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&ldquo;Shampoo. Commander. Serial number 2 Zulu 651 Lima 94.&rdquo; She grunted through her teeth.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita laughs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all she seems to know how to say!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all she&rsquo;s trained to say.&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach glared at Shampoo. She reviewed the PADD that had the information about their prisoners. &ldquo;This is taking too damned long. We&rsquo;re going to end up being compromised with our proverbial pants down.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Commander,&rdquo; Brian said, walking over to Shampoo. He squats slightly to bring himself eye-level with the detained Amazon. &ldquo;I need you to tell me the technical information behind the multi-phasic shielding that the Federation has in place around their lunar Latium deposits.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo opened her purple eyes for what seems like the first time since this started. There were tears pouring out of them. &ldquo;That all you kidnap us for?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita leans close to Be&rsquo;Yach. &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s wrong with the universal translator? Her syntax has been goofy since the beginning!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach just shrugs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. Once we have the information we will put your friends in an escape pod and let them go.&rdquo; Brian replied, trying to put Shampoo at ease.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What about Shampoo?&rdquo; She asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; Lita smiled. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let you go till AFTER we get the Latium. After all, you know our plan now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo grimaced. It would all be over if she just gave up the information. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a total betrayal of all she was sworn to protect. Just some lousy Latium.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She motioned with her head for Brian to come closer. &ldquo;Shampoo tells only you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian moved up so that he would be the only one to hear Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo inhaled deeply and then &ndash; &ldquo;YAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&rdquo; She screamed at the top of her lungs right into Brian&rsquo;s ear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian just dropped like a sack of White Castle at a porn convention. Be&rsquo;Yach ran to her lover&rsquo;s side while Lita came up and backhanded Shampoo with the phaser rifle.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ow.&rdquo; Brian groaned, returning to his feet. &ldquo;Put her back in her cell and bring the engineer. She was already crying. She&rsquo;ll give it up.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nods and motions for the guards to drag Shampoo out. They comply and Lita follows them out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach looks Brian over. &ldquo;Are you okay honey?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian looks at his girlfriend in total shock. &ldquo;Did you just call me a gay dummy?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach laughs. &ldquo;No, I asked if you were O-KAY HON-EY.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian shakes some of the loose parts out of his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be better if you&rsquo;d stop calling me gay. Both of you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Elsewhere on the ship, the guards were dragging a still fighting Shampoo back to her cell. Even though she had been beaten and electrocuted she still had some fight in her. She had to. In most cases of capture, weakness meant death.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guards lower the force shield and throw her in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Are you okay, Shampoo?&rdquo; Akane asked, running over to check on her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shampoo fine.&rdquo; She murmured as she falls to the floor and passes out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guards point their guns at Serena. &ldquo;Okay meatball head. You&rsquo;re next.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita, who was standing outside the detention area, bolted in. The insult she heard could only be directed at one person. &ldquo;Meatball &ndash; Serena?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye and Serena glared at her. Serena resumed crying, but Raye ran to the edge of the cell. Only the guard&rsquo;s rifles kept her from pouncing on Lita.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Lita? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?&rdquo; Raye screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita was no longer in her happy-go-lucky prisoner-torturing mood she was in before.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. Not all of us fit in at Starfleet.&rdquo; She looked to Serena who was cowering in the corner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena couldn&rsquo;t understand how someone she was so close to, someone who she had been a sailor scout with could have become a bad guy. She remembered when it had happened to Tuxedo Mask, but that was due to magical influence. Was Lita under some magical influence?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The look in Lita&rsquo;s eyes was much different. She could tell that it was Lita. Just not the Lita she thought she knew. Serena just couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. Sure, they had all pondered it. What it would be like to be a bad guy. What it would be like living by your rules and no one else&rsquo;s. But none of them had the heart to do it. None of them were evil. Well, at least she didn&rsquo;t think any of them were.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Serena &ndash;&ldquo; Lita&rsquo;s voice was breaking slightly. &ldquo;I need to talk to you. Please, willingly, come with me.&rdquo; Lita&rsquo;s mind was starting to mess with her. She was starting to become overly emotional. Not something that happened a lot anymore. Except for anger. She was always plenty angry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; Raye screamed. &ldquo;If you wanna fuck with someone, fuck with me. I&rsquo;ll make it a little more fun.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita felt anger returning to her. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your job, Raye?&rdquo; Lita grabs a PADD from the counter. &ldquo;Ship&rsquo;s counselor?&rdquo; Lita laughed at her own words. &ldquo;What a joke. I don&rsquo;t need a damned counselor. Not that you&rsquo;d help me anyway. I need engineering information, and it seems by some strange twist in fate Serena is an engineer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Well, you sure as hell won&rsquo;t get any of that from that lame-brain,&rdquo; Raye grumbled, chucking her thumb at Serena. &ldquo;Either take me or kill me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita&rsquo;s smile disappeared. She knew what she had to do. She drew her phaser and shot Raye. It didn&rsquo;t feel right, but she knew she had to do it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The blast hit Raye and sent her flying against the wall. She slid down the wall and to the ground. Serena and Akane both screamed. Akane went to Raye&rsquo;s side.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Grab her,&rdquo; Lita ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guards grabbed Serena. One of them started to twist her arm. Upon the scream let out by Serena Lita fired her gun and shot that guard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I SAID GRAB HER NOT HURT HER!&rdquo; Lita screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guards complied and drug Serena out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Oh, grab that too,&rdquo; Lita said, pointing to the guard she shot.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another lackey came in and drug him out. Lita raised the force shield and began to walk away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;HEY!&rdquo; Akane screamed. &ldquo;WHAT ABOUT COMMANDER HINO?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita, never stopping or looking back called back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. She&rsquo;s just stunned. She&rsquo;ll be up in fifteen minutes or so. Oh, but she will be twice as grumpy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&ldquo;Gee thanks,&rdquo; Akane mumbled to herself.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "a-change-in-tone", "story": 1}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 7, "fields": {"chapter_number": 6, "title": "The Blind Leading The Blind Leading The Stupid", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;MY DARLING SHAMPOO!&rdquo; Mousse bawled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma groaned. &ldquo;Okay then, Mina, can you get me a damage report?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina checked out her terminal. &ldquo;Main power out on all decks, backup power out on decks 6 to 14, hull breaches on decks 4, 5, and 17, emergency force fields are in place and stable.

We need to go get Akane and the others.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; Mina acknowledged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga starts mumbling to himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What was that, Ensign?&rdquo; Ranma glared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I was just commenting to myself that I bet they don&rsquo;t even notice the scratch I made,&rdquo; Ryouga commented, never taking his eyes off the starfield on the viewer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shakes his head and walks over to his ready room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">*SMACK*</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma rubs his face.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Door hydraulics offline!&rdquo; Mina calls out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma rolls his eyes as he pries the door open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He walks over to his desk. He looks outside the window and notices the planet seems to be rotating in an odd direction. He then realizes that the planet is just fine. The Sisko seems to be doing cartwheels.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; Ranma acknowledged. He walks back over to the door. &ldquo;Hey, Mina. You might wanna put stabilizing the ship&rsquo;s yaw on the top of your list before we spin into a star or something.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You know, I thought I felt something. Navigational thrusters are offline.&rdquo; Mina grumbles in acknowledgment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma pulls his doors closed and sits down at his desk. He puts his head down. &ldquo;Damn Akane.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cool plagiarized Star Trek doorbell sound here.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Come in&rdquo; Ranma calls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">*SMACK*</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Doors don&rsquo;t work!&rdquo; He could hear Mina yell. The person on the other side pries the doors open and walks in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Gosnell.&rdquo; Ranma acknowledges.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell rubs his face and slides the doors closed. He sets a glass on Ranma&rsquo;s desk. &ldquo;Thought you might be thirsty.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sniffs it, then downs it. He screams. &ldquo;WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell grins. &ldquo;Vodka. Straight up. My old Captain loved it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma grins. &ldquo;Thanks. Hey, I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell shrugs. &ldquo;It was my bad.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two sit in silence for a few minutes. Ranma, totally lost in thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Damn Akane. If she hadn&rsquo;t been here she wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten captured. I can just imagine what her father is going to do to me once he finds out. Ranma notices that his glass is full again. He slams it and resumes his thoughts. Stupid pops giving me this assignment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A shudder goes through the ship. His communicator chirps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Captain, Commander Anio here. Ships yaw stabilized. Also, I fixed the doors.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Good work Commander. Saotome out.&rdquo; He looks at Gosnell. &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell smiles. &ldquo;I was just about to ask you the same thing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You were not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Okay, so I wasn&rsquo;t. But you can talk to me if you&rsquo;d like. I know that you aren&rsquo;t good at expressing your emotions, but it&rsquo;s not good for you to bottle them all up inside. I sense turmoil in your life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighs. &ldquo;Is it that obvious?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bartender clears his throat. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk here though. Come with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell gets up and walks to the door.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">*SMACK*</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The door slides open. Gosnell glares at Mina, rubbing his face.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It opened, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why are we going to the holodeck?&rdquo; Ranma grumbled. He was starting to feel the vodka.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you somewhere that will make talking to me a lot easier,&rdquo; Gosnell replied. Once at the holodeck he hit some buttons. &ldquo;Computer. Run Gosnell 71 Alpha.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer chirped in compliance and the doors opened.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Denny&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Nothing loosens a tongue like Denny&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Gosnell grinned as they had a seat in a booth. A waitress gives them a couple of glasses of what appears to be water. Ranma sips his.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;More vodka?&rdquo; Ranma asked. &ldquo;Who did this previous captain of your work for? Exxon?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No. Was just easier for him to not deal with things. He was a good man. Not sure what happened to him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s bothering you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Akane was captured.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ah. So I assume that our next order of business is to rescue her?&rdquo; Gosnell asked, between sips of his glass.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yeah. Damn her. I always have to rescue her. She&rsquo;s too stupid to know what&rsquo;s good for her and just stay at home.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Is that really it?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looks up from his menu. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The only reason you are rescuing her? Is it because she&rsquo;s too stupid to do things on her own?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma had never really heard his own words repeated back to him. Well, not from an independent third party. They sounded &ndash; cruel.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head and stared at his menu. &ldquo;Well &ndash; She&rsquo;s not stupid. She&rsquo;s just too stubborn to let me protect her.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Is that your job?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma makes eye contact with Gosnell and becomes somewhat defensive. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Because her father will kill me if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why? No other reason?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Other reason?&rdquo; Ranma didn&rsquo;t like feeling weak. Ranma knew there was another reason but he couldn&rsquo;t admit it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You love her?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WHAT? NO!&rdquo; Ranma yelled and slammed the rest of his vodka. He immediately started flailing his arms at the waitress for a refill.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell rolls his eyes. &ldquo;You do. You&rsquo;re too defensive about it not to.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma&rsquo;s eyes returned to his menu. &ldquo;I like her,&rdquo; Ranma admitted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You ever tell her that?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma thought back to all of the times that he had ALMOST admitted to her that he cared about her. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma let out a sigh. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t feel the same for me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You know that for a fact?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s always yelling at me, hitting me, for various reasons, most of which aren&rsquo;t even my fault.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Like in 10-Forward?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. He was glad Gosnell was finally seeing his point. &ldquo;Yeah. So I think it&rsquo;s obvious she doesn&rsquo;t have any feelings for me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell sighed. &ldquo;I understand. Just like you yell at her and call her stupid and you don&rsquo;t have any feelings for her.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stared blankly at the booth Gosnell was getting up from. He patted Ranma on the back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go see if I can help get the weapons online. Think about it, Captain. I had to see a good thing go bad.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">*SMACK*</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;GAWDDAMEDDOORS!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma completely ignored the smack and the grumbling Gosnell. He was right. Whenever it came up she got completely defensive about her feelings for him. Just like he did when the subject came up. Only she did more so than him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A lot more than him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;OH MY GOD, SHE LOVES ME!&rdquo; Ranma yelled out, catching the attention of the holographic patrons.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma slides out of his booth and runs to the doors.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">*SMACK*</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What Ranma said next was inaudible, which is probably for the best considering the story is already borderline adult.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Daddy &ndash; My ass is sore.&rdquo; George Kuno called.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principal turned from the panel he was working on only to be confronted by his adopted son&rsquo;s bare ass.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;EEK!&rdquo; The principal called out, shoving George out of the way. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever point that at me again. If your ass hurts go regenerate, otherwise help fix the ship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George turned, pulled up his drawers, and looked at his father. &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principal looked at his command console. &ldquo;Find da otha kiekie and bring dem up here. I have a new plan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; George walked off, moving somewhat gingerly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principal went back to work on his panel. &ldquo;Damn that Saotome. How many times is he going to ruin my life?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The memories of Ranma advising him to spend more time with his family continued to run through his head. The time when the principal was hiding from Tatewaki and Ranma pointing out his hiding place fueling his anger.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, the principal was eccentric. A little insane, especially when it came to rules. But he was a kitten compared to the insanity levels that were Kodachi and Tatewaki. Then, once again upon Ranma&rsquo;s advice, he adopts a new child. Who&rsquo;d have known that he adopted the anti-Christ?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s an anti-Christ?&rdquo; George asks, scaring the hell out of the principal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Uh-Guy who is like you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I see father.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all good son! No worries!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George smiled and nodded. He loved getting approval. He knew he was the favorite kiekie.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Behind George were Kodachi and Tatewaki. They both appeared to have been fighting with each other.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principal can only sigh. &ldquo;Have my kiekie been fightin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I shan't tell a lie.&rdquo; Tachi started. &ldquo;This wench insulted the pig-tailed girl and Akane Tendo. I know it was my duty, the Blue Thunder of the alpha quadrant, Tatewaki Kuno, to defend their honor, even against my own sister!&rdquo; Kuno then began his usual nutball laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Kodachi protested. &ldquo;I was defending the honor of my darling Ranma Saotome! He called him an evil sorcerer!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;He is! He has stolen the pig-tailed girl and Akane Tendo from me!&rdquo; Kuno rebutted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shaddup both of you.&rdquo; The principal said, dropping his accent for just a moment. &ldquo;I need de kiekie to help da fixin&rsquo; of da ship! That way we can capture the pigtailed girl and Akane Tendo for you my son and Ranma for you my daughter.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;And Shampoo&rsquo;s eyes for me, pa?&rdquo; George inquired.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yeah. Shampoo&rsquo;s eyes for my evilest keikei.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George smiled. He then heard something in the back of his head. &ldquo;DAD! I&rsquo;m picking up a transmission!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;From where?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stormed onto the bridge. &ldquo;STATUS&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina turned to reply. &ldquo;Impulse power back up. Shields are at 30 percent. Main power has been restored on all decks. Still no warp, weapons, or long-range sensors.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Damn. Ranma thought. &ldquo;What about the bird of prey&rsquo;s plasma trail?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been too long to get an accurate reading. For what it&rsquo;s worth though they couldn&rsquo;t have gotten too far. The cloak won&rsquo;t work above warp 5 without leaving major ionization trails.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Making the cloak pointless. So where&rsquo;s the farthest they could be right now?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina checked her console. &ldquo;Four light-years in each direction.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Great. Only take us a few decades to search that at impulse. Ranma grumbled. &ldquo;Get sensors back online A-S-A-P.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Aye.&rdquo; Mina went back to work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sat down in his new chair that an engineering crew just reinstalled for him. He didn&rsquo;t really like sitting in it. After seeing the last one explode he got a little paranoid.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Captain?&rdquo; Ryouga murmured.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What Ryouga.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ranma, I think I may have found Akane.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma got up and scampered to Ryouga&rsquo;s panel. &ldquo;What? How?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I was practicing pushing the buttons when I accidentally got a communications sub-system online. I found this transmission.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma checked out the screen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>15 A 217 N 22.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Coordinates?&rdquo; Ranma asked Ryouga.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No. Akane&rsquo;s serial number.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">OH MY GOD, SHE&rsquo;S CLEVER! Ranma&rsquo;s brain yelled. Ranma smacked his head to try to get the voice to shut up. The vodka was making it hard enough to think.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Mina! Can you trace this?&rdquo; Ryouga demanded. Mina looked up to Ranma, who just acknowledged his approval of the unauthorized order.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes &ndash; CAPTIAN &ndash; I can. One second.&rdquo; She shoots Ryouga a dirty look. Ryouga returns a look of his own.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Found them,&rdquo; Mina replied. &ldquo;They are traveling at warp 3 towards &ndash; Earth?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What the hell are they doing? Ranma asked himself. &ldquo;Set an intercept course. Best possible speed. Once warp is online do it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga grunted an acknowledgment and the ship took off, surprisingly in the correct direction.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga started to chuckle to himself. <em>I&rsquo;ll save you Akane! Ranma won&rsquo;t!</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga began to cackle out loud. Mina and Ranma looked at him, but he was completely oblivious.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>My ass still hurts though!</em></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane almost enjoyed the fact that the other two were out cold. It was so quiet. Just the sounds of the ship. That and her father's soft sobbing from the cell next to her, but she had gotten used to that over the years.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What really amazed her that for once Ranma&rsquo;s dad was useful.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">MOMENTS EARLIER</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Is everyone over there okay?&rdquo; Genma called over to Akane&rsquo;s cell once the guard had stepped outside.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;More or less,&rdquo; Akane noted. &ldquo;Shampoo and Commander Hino are out cold.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Hrm,&rdquo; Genma grumbled. &ldquo;Do you have any ideas?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane sat back. &ldquo;Maybe if one of us still had their communicators.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma began to dig through his pockets. &ldquo;I have one.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane ran to the corner of the cell. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma smiled. &ldquo;I hide an extra one in the lining of my clothes!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane scowled. &ldquo;Get kidnapped often?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma frowned. &ldquo;More often than you&rsquo;d think.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane began to put her plan to work. One problem though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;How do you get the communicator to me?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma looked around the cell. He noticed there was an air duct on the wall that bordered Akane&rsquo;s cell. &ldquo;Is there an air duct at the top of the adjoining wall on your side?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane looked. Sure enough, there was.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; She replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma shook Soun. &ldquo;I need you to give me a boost.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soun shook his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re almost 300 pounds. Nuts to that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma rolls his eyes. &ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll give you a boost. Stick this through the air duct.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soun gets up and allows Genma to boost him up. He sticks the communicator into the duct. Unfortunately, the airflow sucks it up into the ductwork.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A slight clang is heard. Then another. Then a third. Finally, the communicator comes flopping out of an air duct on the other side of the cell.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane just shrugged and picked it up. &ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You make your daddy proud, Akane.&rdquo; Soun bawled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I will dad.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">BACK TO THE TIME, WE LEFT OFF, PLUS THE TIME IT TOOK YOU TO READ THE LAST BIT, PLUS THE TIME IT TOOK YOU TO READ THIS HEADER.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane had managed to pull most of the wires out of the wall that she needed. She now more than ever enjoyed the simplicity of Klingon engineering. They didn&rsquo;t care how it worked, or about millions upon millions of wires. Everything ran through a central pipe through the center of the ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neat how the brig was right against the pipe. Klingons never have had good judgment when it came to things like that.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane used a hair clip from Shampoo&rsquo;s hair to act as a jumper. The communicator chirped to life.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Admiral, I can&rsquo;t send a voice message. This transmission is too likely to be picked up anyway. What&rsquo;s something that Ranma should be able to recognize?&rdquo; Akane asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Send your phone number.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane shook her head. &ldquo;After they added the last new area code my number is 71 digits long. That&rsquo;s too much.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane went to scratch her neck. Then she realized it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dark-haired girl pulls her dog tags out of her shirt. She smiles. Then frowns. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d better be looking.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane began to tap out the message in Federation Morse code. She knew Ranma probably didn&rsquo;t remember it, but the Sisko&rsquo;s computer will convert it to text.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the bridge, an officer was sitting at a panel half asleep. He didn&rsquo;t notice the slight power increase in the communications array.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach was sitting in the captain&rsquo;s chair. She also was half asleep. She decided to let Brian and Lita get the information from the blonde girl. Her crying was making the quarter Klingon&rsquo;s ears hurt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach let out one of those damned &lsquo;almost asleep&rsquo; snorts. You know, the kind that gets you in trouble in English class. It startled the communications officer. He sat straight up and glared at his console.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; He mumbled to himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This awoke Be&rsquo;Yach. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s transmitting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach just grumbled. &ldquo;Probably just Brian. What&rsquo;s the transmission?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s in Morse code.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach awoke completely now. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know Morse code! Get someone who can decode that!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; The officer yelled as he ran from the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Back in the interrogation room, Lita had sat Serena in the chair. She didn&rsquo;t restrain her or strip her as she did to Shampoo. Lita frowned at her old friend.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Serena &ndash; I, we need information from you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena just shook her head. &ldquo;Raye was right. I&rsquo;m a lame brain. I won&rsquo;t be able to help you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita exhaled deeply. &ldquo;You are not a lame brain. You&rsquo;re smart and you can accomplish a lot. Now, just tell us what we need to know so we can let you and the others go.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena closed her eyes. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t betray my oath. Besides, I know you won&rsquo;t kill us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian walked up to Serena and put his gun in her face. &ldquo;This is getting annoying. I don&rsquo;t know you people, and I won&rsquo;t hesitate to kill you. Now give me the shield frequencies to the multi-phasic shield around the Federation&rsquo;s Lunar Latinum deposits!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita started to protest but Brian pointed his finger at her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We can stop all this with this one haul. I&rsquo;m tired of nearly being killed. I just want my money and my beer and to relax!&rdquo; Brian said to Lita, without turning.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He stared wide-eyed at&nbsp; Serena. &ldquo;Please. The frequencies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena begins to sob. She could tell that he didn&rsquo;t want to kill her, but he would.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Lita said, trying her best to hold back tears.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena opened her eyes to look right up the barrel of the Glock Phaser.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;4 &ndash; 2 &ndash; 9 &ndash;&ldquo; Serena&rsquo;s cut off by the intercom.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;BRIAN!&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach&rsquo;s voice screamed. &ldquo;KUNO SHIP ON INTERCEPT! GOSNELL CLASS ON INTERCEPT! PRISONERS TRANSMITTING DISTRESS CALL!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian holsters his sidearm. &ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; He storms off leaving Lita alone with Serena.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Serena asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita can no longer hold back her tears. &ldquo;You know how I never fit in. Once the Federation banned crime-fighting groups, there was nothing for me to do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I tried to get in with Starfleet Intelligence, but they said I didn&rsquo;t pass my background check! I spent ten goddamned days filling out that 78-page form! What else could I do? The captain gave me a place to live, a job where I am good at what I do. A place where I finally felt I belonged.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;YOU&rsquo;RE A PIRATE!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not always like this. What&rsquo;s the rest of the frequency?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena shook her head. &ldquo;Go to hell.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita exhaled deeply again. She turned and walked out, locking the door behind her.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian comes storming into the cell area and notices the wall panel pulled off. &ldquo;Lower the force field.&rdquo; He orders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian walks in and points his weapon at Akane. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no stun setting on this, for your information.&rdquo; He shoots the communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly Shampoo who is still lying on the floor sweeps out Brian&rsquo;s legs. He falls and Akane pounces on him, getting his weapon. The lackey that was with Brian moves in but is taken out by Raye who was also playing possum on the floor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane and Raye step out, weapons in hand. Shampoo just continues to stand in the cell.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Raye yells.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shampoo no fighting naked.&rdquo; Shampoo replies, reminding them that she is still in her underwear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane removes her jacket and tosses it to Shampoo. She also pulls the pants off of Brian.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Better than nothing.&rdquo; Shampoo acknowledges.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye tosses Shampoo a rifle that she finds on the table. Shampoo walks out and raises the force shield to the cell. Akane walks over to her father&rsquo;s cell.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Dad, Admiral Saotome. Wait about 2 minutes and then head for the nearest escape pod.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They acknowledge her and step to the edge of the cell.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma looks worried. Shampoo and Raye have that &lsquo;need revenge, kill, kill, kill&rsquo; look on their faces. &ldquo;What are you three going to do?&rdquo; Soun asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Pay bitch back.&rdquo; Shampoo grumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye and Akane look at Shampoo, who is glowing a very bright purple aura.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The three women step up to the door of the detention area. It opens and the two guards outside, assuming it&rsquo;s their boss, stand at attention.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;At Ease.&rdquo; Raye snickers shooting both of them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Nice.&rdquo; Akane smiles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;With a cool dry wit like that, I could be an action hero.&rdquo; Raye grins back. &ldquo;We need to find Serena.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane nods. Shampoo looks at the two for the first time. &ldquo;You two go to bridge. Shampoo retrieve friend.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should split &ndash;&ldquo; Raye is cut off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shampoo in charge. Go. Shampoo take care of klutz girl.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye didn&rsquo;t like it, but Shampoo was the commanding officer. She nodded and she and Akane went off towards the bridge.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WARP ONLINE!&rdquo; Mina screams from across the bridge. &ldquo;We can get 7.5.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head. The three Mina&rsquo;s were very pretty. &ldquo;Gud nuff. Go P-Chan!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga turned around. &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T CALL ME THAT!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Sorry Charlotte!&rdquo; Ranma giggled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga can only growl as he engages the engines.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina walks up and sits in the XO seat next to Ranma. She leans over to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Begging the captain&rsquo;s pardon, but you&rsquo;re drunk sir.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turns to her. &ldquo;Yeah. Gosnell. Drink. Denny&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina only sighed. Gosnell was very sexy, but he had horrible timing. &ldquo;Computer, activate bridge E-M-H.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The balding EMH appeared on the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Please state the nature of the medical emergency.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The Captain&rsquo;s drunk.&rdquo; She pointed to Ranma who was starting to melt out of his chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a doctor, not his mother.&rdquo; The EMH smugly replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You not my mudder?&rdquo; Ranma mumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give him something?&rdquo; Mina queried.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The EMH scratches his head. He pulls out his medkit from under a table, loads a medical hypospray, and injects Ranma. &ldquo;This will work.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looks at the EMH. He smiles. Then frowns. Ranma grabs his mouth and bolts for the bathroom. The EMH can only smile.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;When he returns make him drink about 4 liters of water. He&rsquo;ll be fine momentarily then.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Mina says, still looking off in the direction the captain ran. &ldquo;Computer, end E-M-H.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The holographic doctor vanishes. Mina walks over to the replicator and gets the water ready for Ranma. He returns shortly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; Mina asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Better than the crewman who was taking a piss back there,&rdquo; Ranma replies as he slams back into his chair. Mina hands him his water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looks at it suspiciously. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Water,&rdquo; Mina promises.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sips it. Sure enough. He chugs it and starts on his second one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; Ryouga mumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ranma whimpers. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t get us lost again, did you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga scowls. &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t get us lost again. The transmission ended.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;E-T-A to their last known position?&rdquo; Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Seven minutes,&rdquo; Mina replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Mousse. Do you think you can pull yourself together for a little bit?&rdquo; Ranma asked the young man sobbing behind him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Good. When we are in position I want you to ignite a tachyon charge.&rdquo; Ranma smiled. Mousse smiled too. He knew what Ranma was up to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;There for causing their plasma trail to ignite!&rdquo; Mousse understood.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. Ryouga spun around.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;YOU CAD! You could kill Akane like that!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head. &ldquo;The bird of prey isn&rsquo;t going to explode because of a little exhaust fire. Trust me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga didn&rsquo;t like it, but he decided to go along with it for the time being. The only way he could rescue Akane is if he found her first, and Ranma&rsquo;s seemed to be the only plan they had for the time being.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;ALAS! THE BEAUTIFUL AND BUSTFUL AKANE TENDO WANTS ME! SHE LEFT ME SUCH A WONDERFUL LOVE MESSAGE!&rdquo; Kuno yelled as he bounded from one side of the cube to the next. Kodachi could do nothing but glower.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Brother dear, Akane Tendo told me that she would like you better WITHOUT YOUR HEAD!&rdquo; Kodachi snapped her ribbon at Kuno.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ouch,&rdquo; George said as the ribbon wrapped around his wrist. He yanked the other end of the ribbon out of Kodachi&rsquo;s hand and put it in his pocket. &ldquo;Father says the keikei shouldn&rsquo;t fight, so I will make sure the keikei don&rsquo;t fight.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi cocked her head at George. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully smug for someone who was adopted.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George gasps. &ldquo;Adopted? Not I!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno walked over to George. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George just shakes his head. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell? You don&rsquo;t look anything like us!&rdquo; Kodachi pointed out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; George asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re black for one,&rdquo; Kuno replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George turns to Kuno. &ldquo;Oh, so now the black man isn&rsquo;t good enough to be your brother?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno shakes his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George shakes the tears out of his eyes. &ldquo;I HATE YOU BOTH!&rdquo; He runs from the room as the principal runs in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?&rdquo; He screams.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi laughs. &ldquo;We made George cry!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno laughs as well. &ldquo;Obviously not a true Kuno.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.&rdquo; The principal mumbles to himself as he watches the self-destructive thoughts of George Kuno go through his mind.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principal looks at his two children. &ldquo;You bozos on ya own! I&rsquo;m getting back to de islands while da getting&rsquo;s good!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principal runs off to his escape pod and ejects.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno looks to his sister. &ldquo;You know how to fly this thing?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi responds with a negative headshake.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll have to apologize to George.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi responds with a positive headshake.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; George grumbles as he walks back in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi moves behind her original brother. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not mad at us?&rdquo; She asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George shakes his head. &ldquo;We have an objective to complete. We won&rsquo;t let &ndash; father down.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The elder two Kunos nod and they get to work chasing down the signal from Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Outside, in a small sphere-shaped escape pod &ndash;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;And dey wonder why I&rsquo;m so crazy.&rdquo; Principal Kuno says, rocking back and forth.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane sent a quick hand signal to Raye letting her know that there are three crewmen standing by the door to the bridge of the Klingon ship. Raye nods and slinks around a corner as Akane creeps forward.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;So, have you seen the latest episode of Survivor: East St. Louis?&rdquo; The tallest crewman asked the other two.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; Akane called. The crewmen turn to her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Who got voted off this week?&rdquo; Another crewman asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane scratches her head. &ldquo;I think it was V&rsquo;Talk.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The crewmen all groan. &ldquo;They always pick on the Vulcan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane nods in agreement before remembering that she needs to shoot these people. She draws her phaser and takes two of them out. The other dodges the blast and begins to go for his phaser, but is quickly taken down by Raye, who was just around the corner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two girls walk to the bridge. The doors don&rsquo;t open. Akane hits the release button. Nothing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the deal?&rdquo; Akane whispers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You need an access code.&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach grins. Standing next to her are 10 crewmen, all with phaser rifles. &ldquo;Lower your weapons.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane and Raye comply. The crewmen take Akane and Raye back into custody.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Bragh!&rdquo; Genma-panda yells from farther down the corridor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach takes a step back, but smiles. &ldquo;The captain may be afraid of you, but I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma whips out a sign. <em>&lsquo;Look who I have.&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soun appears, dragging Brian.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>&lsquo;If you want him back, release us.&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian is about to go nuts. The panda is scaring the hell out of him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach groans. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for this. Shoot them all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lackeys comply and quickly incapacitate Genma, Soun, Akane, and Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian gets up and runs behind Be&rsquo;Yach. &ldquo;Put the panda in an escape pod. The ambassador too. They are too much of a liability. Where&rsquo;s the one who can&rsquo;t talk right?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach shrugs. All the lackeys look at each other.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;MORONS!&rdquo; Brian screams. &ldquo;FIND THEM!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lackeys start to take off. Brian shoots one of them. &ldquo;FORGETTING SOMETHING?&rdquo; He points to Akane and company. The remaining lackeys grab them and head off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian just turns to Be&rsquo;Yach. &ldquo;Who hired these yay-hoos?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach meekly looks away. &ldquo;You said no more than 10 dollars an hour. You get what you pay for.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian curses his own cheapness. &ldquo;No worries. Once we get the Latium we can retire.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach grins. &ldquo;Did you get the frequency?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian shakes his head. &ldquo;Part of it. But I know the Federation. There are only six possible combinations of the rest frequency. We don&rsquo;t have to de-cloak to lower their shields. What&rsquo;s the ETA of the Starfleet ship and the Kuno ship?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach opens the bridge door and walks in. She checks a panel. &ldquo;30 minutes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian takes his seat on the bridge. &ldquo;Excellent. Once the Latium is on board we can offload the prisoners and get the hell out of federation space.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach hops on Brian&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;What about the crew and Lita?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian sighs. &ldquo;Send the crew down with the prisoners. Lita wants to stay with us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach doesn&rsquo;t really care for that. She knows how the captain flirts with her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re thinking.&rdquo; Brian smiled as he dug something out of his pocket. &ldquo;No worries, however. You are the only one I love.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo&rsquo;s unfamiliarity with the layout of Klingon Bird-Of-Preys was becoming obvious to her when she noticed she passed the same plasma conduit. She was getting pretty pissed. She cursed to herself as the turbolift door opened. She hides in a crevice. Lita walks out of the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As she walked down the corridor she stops. Lita can tell when she is being watched. She starts to go for her phaser when she feels cold metal on the back of her head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Where is Serena?&rdquo; Shampoo asked. &ldquo;Bitch no want to try nothing. Throw your gun across the room.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita complied. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the brig.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo shoves the phaser harder into the back of Lita&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;No lie to Shampoo. Where is she?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita remains silent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Is it worth dying for? Especially since Federation move deposits from the lunar lock up?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Lita groaned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Take me to girl. NOW!&rdquo; Shampoo yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita turns back toward the turbo lift with Shampoo inches behind her. They get into it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Deck three,&rdquo; Lita commands. The lift goes in motion. &ldquo;What do you mean the moved the deposits?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo chuckled. &ldquo;You stupid? They move deposits. New place much safer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The turbolift doors open. Lita and Shampoo walk out and down the hall. They get near the interrogation room. There is a guard posted outside.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Tell him to leave.&rdquo; Shampoo ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita inhaled deeply. &ldquo;Crewman &ndash; you&rsquo;re dismissed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The crewman can&rsquo;t see where Lita is, but since he recognized her voice, he walks off in the opposite direction.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo forces Lita over to the door. &ldquo;Open it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita punches in her access code into the door. It slides open. Serena is just sitting in the chair crying.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Commander!&rdquo; Shampoo yelled. &ldquo;Get over here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena looks up and sees Shampoo with Lita. She hops off the chair and runs to the door, taking a good, hard look at Lita before exiting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Shampoo asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena only nods. Shampoo pulls Lita back out and faces her toward the turbo lift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita decides that she has to try and get away from Shampoo and tell Brian of what she has learned. Going to Earth with six Starfleet prisoners would not be good, especially if they weren&rsquo;t able to get anything out of it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As they are walking down the hall, Lita fakes tripping. As she moves forward she causes Shampoo to start to lose her balance. As she does, Lita turns around and punches her. The impact causes Shampoo&rsquo;s grip on the phaser to loosen. It bounces to the floor. Before Lita can get to it, Shampoo grabs Lita&rsquo;s ankles and trips her completely. She falls, but in the opposite direction of the phaser.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo turns and goes for the phaser but Lita manages to get a grip on Shampoo&rsquo;s legs. The phaser had bounced just outside Shampoo&rsquo;s reach.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Serena!&rdquo; Shampoo calls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena runs over and grabs the phaser. She points it at Lita, who has grabbed Shampoo by the neck and pulls her to her feet. With her other hand, Lita pulls a knife from one of the cargo pockets on her pants and holds it to Shampoo&rsquo;s neck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Even though I know you won&rsquo;t shoot me, Serena, be advised I will slit this whore&rsquo;s neck as I fall.&rdquo; Lita grins. &ldquo;Put the phaser down, and neither of you will be hurt.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena is shaking. She joined Starfleet engineering so that she wouldn&rsquo;t be put in any positions like this anymore. What was she to do? She didn&rsquo;t want Shampoo to die, but she didn&rsquo;t want to kill Lita either. Where&rsquo;s one of those goddamned roses when I need one? She thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately for her, the decision was made for her.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sisko shook madly. Warp 9.97 was not an approved speed. However, the fact the Kuno ship found and forced the pirate ship to de-cloak added extra emergency to the situation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Kuno&rsquo;s were pummeling the ship. Her shields would be compromised in minutes and the ship could be destroyed shortly thereafter. Ranma didn&rsquo;t figure that Kuno would destroy the ship till after he got Akane on board, but there was still his father and the others.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ranma?&rdquo; Mousse called out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;There is an escape pod about 9,000 kilometers aft of the bird of prey. It&rsquo;s got one panda and one human on board.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; Ranma ran up there and verified Mousse&rsquo;s readings. &ldquo;Is it safe?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina checked her console. &ldquo;For now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head. &ldquo;We will have to come back for it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Seconds later the Sisko dropped out of warp. &ldquo;MOUSSE! Order the Kuno&rsquo;s to cease fire.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse shook his head. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t responding.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;THEY&rsquo;RE COMING ABOUT!&rdquo; Mina yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;ALL WEAPONS FIRE!&rdquo; Ranma shouted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following barrage of fire seems to last forever. In reality, it only lasted a few seconds.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Kuno ship let loose everything it had in the way of firepower. Its cutting beam. Its torpedoes. Its phasers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sisko&rsquo;s shields glowed a bright blue as they were stressed to their maximum.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Blue and red orbs projected themselves from the Sisko. Volley after volley of photon torpedoes slammed into the Kuno ship. Not nearly as effective this time as they were the last time. Before his departure, the principal had made the necessary corrections to the shield emitters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;SHIELDS FAILING!&rdquo; Mousse screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stared blankly at the viewscreen as 15 Kuno torpedoes headed towards the Sisko, and 30 headed towards the Kuno ship.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">And then it was over.

The rear wall of the bridge was on fire. Mousse was unconscious on the floor. Mina was unconscious, laying across her console, and Ryouga was nowhere to be seen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma ran over and checked Mina&rsquo;s vitals. She&rsquo;s alive. He continued to the tactical station. He checked Mousse. He&rsquo;s alive.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse let out a groan. &ldquo;We won?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. &ldquo;I need to know how the pirate ship is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse nods. He stands up and begins to check out his console.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Across the bridge, Mina lets out a groan. &ldquo;Owch.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You okay, Commander?&rdquo; Ranma called out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Mina says as she tries to get her panel to work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse shakes his head. &ldquo;They are in bad shape. Multiple hull breaches &ndash; there are a few bodies floating out there &ndash; &ldquo; Mousse pauses. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any of them are our crew.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma taps his communicator. &ldquo;Transporter room &ndash; Are transporters online?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Aye, sir.&rdquo; The transporter chief replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Beam all the bodies that are outside of the pirate ship to sickbay.&rdquo; Ranma turns to Mina. &ldquo;You have the bridge. Mousse, get some security officers and come with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse hits his comm. badge and initiates the order to meet them in transporter room two. Then he and Ranma get into the turbolift and leave the bridge as replacement officers come onto the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">MOMENTS EARLIER ON THE PIRATE SHIP</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita looks around as several explosions rock the ship. Shampoo uses this distraction to apply a pressure point to Lita&rsquo;s hand, causing her to drop the knife. Shampoo then does a really impressive spinning jump kick, sending Lita backward towards the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly another explosion causes the ship to lurch violently. Shampoo falls forward and Serena drops the phaser she had. Lita also falls over.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another explosion. This one takes out the wall behind Lita. Lita is blown out into open space. Shampoo and Serena also go flying towards the breech when the emergency force shield kicks in. The momentum carries Shampoo into the force shield. The electrical charge in the force shield causes her to get knocked back forward about 10 feet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena runs over to Shampoo who acknowledges that she will be okay. Serena looks around for Lita.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Lita?&rdquo; Serena cries. &ldquo;LITA!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo shakes her head. She points to the breach. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena drops to her knees and cries.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo just stays on the floor, still reeling from what just about happened to her.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach screams. It was an engagement ring that Brian just handed her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I love you too!&rdquo; She squeaked, kissing him passionately. &ldquo;This is the best day ever!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach&rsquo;s attitude was immediately changed when she went flying off the chair after the first explosion hit.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian&rsquo;s ship comes to a stop and the cloak disengages. Brian, who was also thrown to the floor attempts to stand up, but is sent back to the floor by another explosion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;30 MINUTES MY ASS! SHIELDS!&rdquo; He screamed to the crewman operating the console.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;THEY ARE UP, BUT NOT HOLDING!&rdquo; He screamed back. &ldquo;77%!&rdquo; Another explosion. &ldquo;54%!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;RETURN FIRE!&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach yelled, crawling over to a handrail.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Weapons offline.&rdquo; The crewman replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another one perked up. &ldquo;Engines offline &ndash; Warp core overloading &ndash; breach in 45 seconds!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; Brian cried. &ldquo;Eject the core.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The engineering officer nods. &ldquo;Ejected.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another explosion rocks the ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Sheilds down.&rdquo; The first crewman dryly states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dead in the water.&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach whimpered, tightly holding onto the handrail with one hand and her ring with the other.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two more explosions hit.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;HULL BREACH! DECK 3 SECTION A AND DECK 9 SECTION B!&rdquo; A crew person screams.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian grabs Be&rsquo;Yach and starts to pull her towards a door on the port side of the bridge. &ldquo;ABANDON SHIP!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The crew people on the bridge hit some buttons and take off. They didn&rsquo;t need to be told twice.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WAIT, SIR! A Starfleet ship has engaged the Kuno cube!&rdquo; A crew person who, for some reason that isn&rsquo;t really relevant, was still at his station noted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian looks to Be&rsquo;Yach. She nods to him. They return to their seats. &ldquo;Start repairs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Sir &ndash; there are bodies outside the breeches.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach pulls out her communicator. &ldquo;Be&rsquo;Yach to Lita &ndash; Status.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Silence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Be&rsquo;Yach to Lita.

Federation security team. 16 people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;SECURE THE BRIDGE!&rdquo; Brian screams. He grabs a security guard running by. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let ANYONE through that door, do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The frightened officer nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo; Be&rsquo;Yach whispers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian sighs. &ldquo;Wait it out. Hope that they cut their losses, get their people, and leave.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What if some of the bodies outside the breaches are their crew?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian puts his head in his hands. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re in a shit load of trouble. We need to get impulse back online.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach starts to walk off but Brian keeps his grip on her hand. &ldquo;You stay. Someone else can do it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach nods.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma and seven security officers materialize on Deck 5 the deck where the brig is. It&rsquo;s dark. The Kuno onslaught knocked out most of the power to the deck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Okay people. Be careful who you are shooting at. Our people may not still be in uniform.&rdquo; Ranma orders. The officers acknowledge the order and follow Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The brig is 50 meters down this corridor.&rdquo; The lead security officer notes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The group walks down the corridor. Two officers get in front of Ranma and hit the door release. It slides open and the team storms in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The resistance they encounter is minimal. As a matter of fact, there wasn&rsquo;t any. Both the officers who were guarding the brig were killed in the Kuno assault.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;AKANE!&rdquo; Ranma called out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;RANMA!&rdquo; Akane replied. The group goes over to the cell where her voice is heard. The force shield is still active. Inside the cell are Akane and Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Shampoo and Serena?&rdquo; Ranma asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;They took Serena to interrogate her and Shampoo went to rescue her,&rdquo; Akane informs Ranma as one of the officers gets the force shield to drop.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma grabs three of the 5 communicators he brought. He tosses them to each person. He then hits his own. &ldquo;Saotome to Sisko &ndash; Three to beam directly to sickbay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Aye, sir.&rdquo; The transporter chief replied. &ldquo;Also, sir, we&rsquo;re got your father and the ambassador. They&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Thank you, Chief,&rdquo; Ranma replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back there in a few Akane.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane smiled as the transporter beam grabs them. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d come.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma smiles and mouths something to Akane as she disappears. He then turns to the rest of his team. &ldquo;Time to find the others. Saotome to Mousse &ndash; Akane, and Raye have been rescued. Any luck?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Between phaser shots, Mousse manages to get off a reply. &ldquo;No sir. They have about twenty people guarding the door to the bridge. Transporting in can&rsquo;t happen due to those damned Klingon transport inhibitors.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Do what you can,&rdquo; Ranma replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to search for the others. Saotome out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You heard him!&rdquo; Mousse yells to his guards.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guards continue their phaser assault of the pirates guarding the bridge, but fail to obtain any ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A federation security officer screams as he is hit with a phaser blast. The pirates have begun to get the upper hand, and are advancing on the security forces.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse grumbles to himself. He hates to say what he is about to say. He turns to one of the officers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We need a better position. Fall back.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guard nods in agreement and motions for two of the officers to fire rapid-fire shots, enough to hold off the pirates while the others start to move back into the corridor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another officer screams as he is dropped. Mousse turns to him, and then Mousse gets hit in the arm. The second in command officers slaps his comm badge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Valdez to Saotome. Lt. Mousse has been hit, we&rsquo;ve lost two of our team, request instructions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Get out of there. Return to the Sisko.&rdquo; Ranma&rsquo;s voice orders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Aye, sir &ndash; Valdez to Sisko &ndash; Lock on to our coordinates and transport us directly to sickbay!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">An acknowledgment is heard and the security team vanishes. One of the pirates pulls out his communicator. &ldquo;Captain &ndash; the assault on the bridge has been neutralized. They&rsquo;ve left the ship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian looks to a lackey manning a station. &ldquo;There are still seven Starfleet bastards on the ship.&rdquo; The lackey informs him. &ldquo;Plus two of the prisoners.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Is the cloak working yet?&rdquo; Brian asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach, who had scurried over to another station, answers. &ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian shakes his head. &ldquo;Transport ALL of the Starfleet personnel to their ship, engage the cloak and get us out of here, best possible speed in any freakin&rsquo; direction. Just get us out of here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach nods to him. Brian walks over to a closet in the aft of the bridge and grabs a bottle. &ldquo;Guess I picked the wrong day to stop drinking!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach calls out to Brian. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone, and we&rsquo;re cloaked.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian took a swig of his swill. &ldquo;Roll call. Find out who&rsquo;s missing and not responding.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach and a lackey work at their station for a couple of minutes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Brian &ndash; we&rsquo;ve lost-&ldquo; Be&rsquo;Yach shakes her head. &ldquo;37 crewmen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian can only stare at Be&rsquo;Yach. 37 are a lot on a ship like the Sisko with almost 500 crew, but it&rsquo;s a tremendous loss on this ship. Brian only had 61 people, including him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It appears that 14 of them were blown out of hull breaches.&rdquo; The lackey adds.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian just shakes his head. In the last major confrontation he was in, he lost one crewman. And even that was too much.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Find out whose bodies are still on board. They deserve a funeral. We also should have a memorial for those blown out the breeches.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be&rsquo;Yach nods and issues the order to the lackey. She then looks in her hand. She had been holding onto the ring so hard that the diamond cut her hand. She walks over to Brian and takes his hand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be alright.&rdquo; She says.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian nods. He takes the ring from her hand. He gets out of his chair, gets on one knee, and slides the ring on her finger.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Something needs to go right today.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Commander.&rdquo; A bridge officer calls to Mina. &ldquo;The away team and two others have been beamed back to the ship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina stands and looks to the screen as the bird of prey cloaks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Aino to Saotome. What&rsquo;s your status?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma&rsquo;s voice replies. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine. Who all was beamed aboard.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina looks to the officer. &ldquo;Commander Tsukino and Commander Shampoo were beamed into sickbay. Then I show you and the six members of the assault team were transported to a cargo bay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Glad the other two are on board,&rdquo; Ranma called out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be in sickbay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Aye, sir. The bird of prey cloaked. What do you want to be done.&rdquo; Mina asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in no condition to chase them or get caught in another confrontation. Let them go.&rdquo; Ranma replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Aye, sir. Aino out.&rdquo; Mina sat back down. She was still worried about Serena. Raye, though, was able to take care of herself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">IN SICKBAY</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked in. Sickbay was very busy. There were massive injuries in the battles, but surprisingly only one Sisko crewmember lost their life.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma was happy about that. He always felt overly bad for those who lost their lives in battle, even though he knew that sometimes that was part of the job.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What really got to him were the 14 bodies lying in the far end of sickbay. The bodies retrieved from the bird of prey&rsquo;s hull breaches. Most of them were in plain clothes, but one was wearing a uniform. He almost thought it was one of his officers, but then he realized the uniform was a little different than Starfleet ones.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked over to where Akane was examining Shampoo. Raye was standing next to Serena who was also being examined by a different medical tech.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; Ranma asked Akane who seemed a little startled to hear his voice.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s been beaten and there are traces of electrical damage to her muscles. She is going to need to stay in here for a while, but I think she will be fine in the long run.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded and smiled at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane only smiled back and returned to her work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;How are you, counselor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye shook her head. &ldquo;Physically I am fine.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma didn&rsquo;t know exactly what that meant.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Her &ndash;&ldquo; Raye pointed to Lita&rsquo;s body on an exam table being prepped to go into stasis. &ldquo;We knew here. She was &ndash;&ldquo; Raye paused, choking back what seemed to be a tear. &ldquo;a friend.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma put his hand on her shoulder. She gave him a forced smile.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked over to where Serena was. She was very shaken up. Ranma looked down at her and smiled. She also was required to force a smile.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; He asked her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena shook her head. &ldquo;Been better.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded in understanding. &ldquo;You knew her too?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena nodded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma tapped his comm. badge. &ldquo;Saotome to Bridge &ndash; Commander Aino, can you come to sickbay?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Acknowledged.&rdquo; Mina&rsquo;s voice replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked at Serena again and turned to Raye. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for your loss. As your captain I don&rsquo;t expect you to return to duty for a couple of days. As your friend, I just want to say if you need anything, let me know.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye and Serena both nod a thank you to Ranma. He then turns to Akane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on the bridge. Don&rsquo;t be a stranger.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane chuckled and nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked out of sickbay. He noticed Mina in the hallway. &ldquo;They need a friend.&rdquo; He informed her. She nodded and went in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina smiled when she saw Raye. She jogged over to her and gave her a hug. She then gave Serena an even bigger one. Serena was crying. She looked to Raye who also almost looked like she was about to cry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Mina asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye simply pointed. Mina turned to the far side of sickbay.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Oh my God.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tatewaki was not one for confined spaces. The cube was fine because it was enormous. The escape pod &ndash; not so good.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I, Tatewaki Kuno, demand we get a bigger ship.&rdquo; He grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I, Kodachi &ndash; the black rose, concur.&rdquo; Kodachi concurred.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George just rolled his eyes. &ldquo;And where the hell do you suggest we get one?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tatewaki pointed to a sensor blip. &ldquo;How about that one?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George smacks Tatewaki. &ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S THE SHIP THAT JUST NEARLY KILLED US!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi squeezed her way up to the main console. &ldquo;How about that one?&rdquo; She pointed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George nearly blew a gasket. &ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S THE SAME SHIP! Don&rsquo;t you idiots know anything about space travel?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The elder Kuno&rsquo;s looked at each other for a few seconds. &ldquo;Daddy did all the steering.&rdquo; Kodachi finally answered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You know that you could read his thoughts. All you had to do was pull his piloting memories up.&rdquo; George explained.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tatewaki looked at his sister who felt equally as stupid. Tacchi, in no hurry to admit he was a moron, looked back to George. &ldquo;Yeah well if you are so good then why was our ship destroyed?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George turned around and pounced on the Blue Thunder. &ldquo;MORON BECAUSE YOU LOWERED THE SHIELDS TO BEAM AKANE TENDO AND THAT BLASTED PIG TAILED GIRL ON BOARD!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget about my darling Ranma!&rdquo; Kodachi helpfully added.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George looked up at his non-biological sister. &ldquo;Idiots! Both of you! Idiots! You do know that the pig-tailed girl and Ranma Saotome are the same person, right?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi looks to her brother who is becoming very blue from George choking him. &ldquo;Nonsense.&rdquo; She replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;YEAH-GAK!&rdquo; Kuno gasps. George releases his grip on Tacchi&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sorcery from the evil Ranma Saotome!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George rolls his eyes. &ldquo;Even I know this and I&rsquo;m a new character!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;SORCERY!&rdquo; Kuno bellows.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;SILENCE BROTHER!&rdquo; Kodachi yells, whipping out her rhythmic gymnastic tools.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tacchi draws his bokken. &ldquo;ON GUARD DEAR SISTER!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George gets shoved to the deck as the two attack each other in this one-man escape pod. George begins to dig around for a phaser. He&rsquo;s either going to kill them or himself. He&rsquo;s not quite sure which yet.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma steps out of the turbolift. He looks around the bridge. It&rsquo;s in bad shape. There are wires hanging from the walls, steam shooting from some pointless steam duct, and a couple of exploded panels. Ralph Nader would have kittens if he knew how easily things exploded on a starship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He looks to his chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not a scratch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;How nice.&rdquo; Ranma grins as he sits down. &ldquo;Ensign Hibiki &ndash; Set course for space dock. Warp 4.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">An ensign at the helm turns around. It&rsquo;s not Ryouga though. She is wearing a bandana like Ryouga&rsquo;s. Hopefully, she&rsquo;s not a long-lost cousin.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma laughs at his own joke when he realizes a missing crewman is not a laughing matter.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where Ensign Hibiki is sir. But warp is not working right now.&rdquo; She replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stupid warp. And damn that damn Ryouga. He&rsquo;s probably down in sickbay drooling over Akane, Ranma thinks. &ldquo;Computer &ndash; Where is Ensign Ryouga Hibiki?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer replies. &ldquo;Ensign Hibiki is not aboard the Sisko.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; Ranma fumes. &ldquo;Where the hell is he?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;He transported off the Sisko at 23:19.&rdquo; The computer replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">20 minutes ago. &ldquo;Where did he go?&rdquo; Ranma asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ensign Hibiki transported to the Klingon vessel.&rdquo; Says the computer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; Ranma growls. He turns around. At least Mousse was at his station. He notices that Mousse is blankly staring at the viewscreen though. Ranma understood. Even though he&rsquo;d never admit it, he&rsquo;d probably be just as distraught if Akane was the one who was nearly killed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Are you okay, Lt.?&rdquo; Ranma asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse just nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Akane says she&rsquo;s going to be okay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse finds some comfort in that. Not much though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Can you figure out where the bird of prey went?&rdquo; Ranma asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse shakes his head. That&rsquo;s a negative. &ldquo;All sensors are down. Communications down, shields, weapons, you name it, it&rsquo;s broke.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That moron. Hope he can fend for himself for a while.&rdquo; Ranma angrily said, adjusting himself in his chair. It was going to be a long night.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">MEANWHILE ON THE CRIPPLED BIRD OF PREY</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WHERE THE HELL AM I NOW?&rdquo; Ryouga screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Klingon computer barked a reply. Again. &ldquo;You are STILL on deck 8, section C.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WHERE&rsquo;S AKANE?!&rdquo; Ryouga yelled at it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;There is STILL no Akane on board.&rdquo; The computer dryly replied. It would seem this computer wasn&rsquo;t anywhere as near as friendly as the Starfleet ones. And this one was getting really sick and tired of Ryouga. It seems only Ryouga could make an inanimate object like a computer become annoyed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga was starting to realize that maybe this wasn&rsquo;t one of the best ideas he had ever had. He had to be the one to rescue Akane though. If Ranma found her first it would be just one more battle against his archenemy that he had lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga came to the conclusion that another loss wouldn&rsquo;t be acceptable. So while no one was looking, Ryouga set the ship on autopilot and snuck to the transporter room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He then rigged it not to alert the crew of the bird of prey by transporting himself to the laundry room. It was weird because for whatever reason that was the only room on the ship without security sensors. It was certainly convenient for boarding discreetly though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately for Ryouga that just gave him farther to go from where he appeared to the brig. He knew that the brig was on deck 5, but he had no idea how to get there. He was pretty sure he&rsquo;d seen this plasma conduit before.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Somehow he convinced himself that getting lost on this ship wasn&rsquo;t his fault. He had concluded that every section of the ship looked alike. To top off his troubles the Klingon computers wouldn&rsquo;t give him directions to sensitive locations, like the brig.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also realized that the Sisko was LONG gone now. The shooting had stopped. The ship had re-cloaked and he couldn&rsquo;t hear any more phaser fire. Could it be that the bastard just gave up and left without Akane?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;All I have to do is find a turbolift,&rdquo; Ryouga told himself. He knew he had a problem though when he found out that none of the doors were labeled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Damned Klingons!&rdquo; He cursed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly he heard footsteps. Ryouga slinked into a shadow and waited. He would force this guy to tell him where Akane was.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man walked past Ryouga. Ryouga pounced.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man hit the ground with Ryouga on top of him. Ryouga pulled his phaser and held it to the back of the guy&rsquo;s head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WHERE&rsquo;S AKANE?!&rdquo; Ryouga screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man slightly turned his head. It was Brian.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;AKANE! ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU KIDNAPPED! THE LOVE OF MY LIFE! THAT&rsquo;S WHO!&rdquo; Ryouga screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian got a look at him a little better. &ldquo;STARFLEET! I thought we sent all of you yahoo&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga shifted a little. &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I transported everyone back to your ship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;AKANE TOO?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes, Akane too,&rdquo; Brian replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Ryouga chuckled. &ldquo;Can you take me back then?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Not with you sitting on top of me,&rdquo; Brian replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga got off of him but kept his phaser trained on him. Brian shook his head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not necessary. I just want out of this mess. I&rsquo;m going to take you to a shuttle-bay. You can have a shuttlecraft. I can&rsquo;t take you back there. They&rsquo;ll blow me out of the sky!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga nodded. &ldquo;Take me to a shuttlecraft then. I&rsquo;ll keep this out though.&rdquo; He said, motioning towards the phaser.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; Brian replied, starting to walk towards a turbolift. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wasted I could give a shit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two stepped into the turbolift. Ryouga was even more pissed now that he realized he walked past that turbolift at least four times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;How do I know that you really released her?&rdquo; Ryouga growled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian sighed. &ldquo;Computer. How many Starfleet officers are on board now?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer obliged. &ldquo;One.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga shoved the phaser back in Brian&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I knew it! You do still have her.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Were you born stupid or did you just grow that way? The one Starfleet officer is you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga had to acknowledge that the logic behind that was sound. Well, the part about him being the one Starfleet officer, not the part about him being stupid. He still wasn&rsquo;t convinced though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No &ndash; I want you to take me up to the brig so I can see for myself.&rdquo; Ryouga smiled at his own idea. He was so smart.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Oh come on, man!&rdquo; Brian complained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired and I suspect I am going to begin puking at any moment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga poked Brian with the phaser. &ldquo;No! Do as I say! Diddy MOW! DIDDY MOW I SAY!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Diddy mow?&rdquo; Brian asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I saw it in a movie.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; Brian groaned. &ldquo;Computer, change &ndash; Brig.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift shifted in directions. After a short while, it stopped. The doors opened and three guards saw Ryouga and started to draw their weapons.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Brian called to them. &ldquo;He just wants to see something then he&rsquo;s leaving. Finish your fixing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guards nodded and resumed their work. Brian took Ryouga into the cell area. &ldquo;See. Empty.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga took a look around. He walks back over to Brian.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;How do I know you don&rsquo;t have her somewhere else?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian let out an exasperated sigh. &ldquo;Shit dude. Here, go wander the ship and let me know when you are ready to leave. I&rsquo;m going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga knew that if he started wandering again it could be years before he got off this blasted rattrap. Ryouga calls to Brian as he starts to walk out of the brig.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No, wait. I believe you. Take me to the shuttle bay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian motions for him to catch up. The two get back into the lift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shuttle bay One.&rdquo; Brian orders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift complies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga decides that he has another question for the pirate captain. &ldquo;Why did you kidnap them?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian groans. Talking made his head hurt. &ldquo;I needed the frequencies for the metaphasic shielding at the lunar Latium depository.&rdquo; Brian didn&rsquo;t even realize that he just signed his own arrest warrant if this guy told on him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga, not thinking replies. &ldquo;492.225 gigahertz. But they moved the deposits to a Vulcan moon.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brian stands perfectly still. Screw the arrest warrant, this guy&rsquo;s a dumbass! However, now Brian is very pissed off at himself. Could it have been that easy? All of this, the death, the torture, the damage, THE PANDA, and the answer came to him that easily? &ldquo;Umm &ndash; is - is the frequency the same?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yeah &ndash; metaphasic shields only work in the 492 gigahertz band,&rdquo; Ryouga replies, not realizing how helpful he&rsquo;s being. The fact that he is going to have to come up with something good to save his job is distracting him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift doors open. They walk into the shuttle bay.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have any problem departing. Our warp core is gone so we are only moving at impulse. Your ship is that way somewhere.&rdquo; Brian points to his left.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Ryouga shoots the captain, boards the shuttle, and departs. Brian starts to stagger to his feet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Fuck. Three bottles of Jack and a phaser blast don&rsquo;t mix well.&rdquo; He notes to himself as he sprints to the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As he enters the lift he mumbles to himself. &ldquo;I never take the right prisoners. See this is why I don&rsquo;t take prisoners. It&rsquo;s settled. No more prisoners, especially Starfleet prisoners. Talk about a pain in the ass!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He whips out his communicator. &ldquo;Brian to Be&rsquo;Yach! You will never believe what just happened!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">ON THE SISKO A FEW HOURS LATER</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; Mousse called out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to Mousse. Ranma hoped it was good news. He was already pissed that his dad had decided to play rank and take his chair. The XO seat wasn&rsquo;t anywhere near as comfortable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Long-range sensors online. There is a Klingon shuttlecraft 2 light-years bearing 209 mark 002. It&rsquo;s got one person on board with a Starfleet communicator. It&rsquo;s just flying in circles.&rdquo; Mousse replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Hail the idiot,&rdquo; Ranma ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse complied. Ryouga appeared on the screen. &ldquo;Uh &ndash; Hi Ranma.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head. &ldquo;What the hell are you doing?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga looked at his panel and then back at Ranma. &ldquo;Oh, just hanging around. You know how it goes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse laughed. Ranma was about to scold him when he realized Genma was laughing too.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Christ. Ryouga, go to a full stop. We&rsquo;ll be there in a little bit to pick you up. Sisko out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The screen went back to the starfield. &ldquo;Go to him,&rdquo; Ranma ordered the helmsman. She obliged and the ship took off at low warp towards Ryouga.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "resolution", "story": 1}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 9, "fields": {"chapter_number": 8, "title": "Epilogue", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Captain&rsquo;s log: Stardate 60004.8.

Ranma did know that people are not always as they seem. He&rsquo;s also learned that situations aren&rsquo;t always as they appear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stood and walked out onto the bridge. He noticed Shampoo was there, sitting in her chair. He smiled at her. &ldquo;Nice to see you back on the bridge, Shampoo.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo sent back an attempt to smile, but she was still sore and tired. Ranma understood that she had pride so he wasn&rsquo;t going to point out an obvious weakness.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He took a look at the view screen expecting to see stars. Instead, he saw a ship start to de-cloak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;MOUSSE! SHEILDS!&rdquo; Ranma screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo stood. They expected to see the pirate ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They did not expect to see what they saw.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Right in front of them sat a Defiant-class ship. Ranma turned to Mousse, but he stopped him before Ranma could even start.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re hailing us.&rdquo; Mousse told him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;On screen,&rdquo; Ranma said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man who appeared on the screen wasn&rsquo;t someone Ranma was familiar with. He did notice that he bore the rank of admiral.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Sorry to startle you, Captain.&rdquo; The admiral said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; Ranma lied. &ldquo;What can we do for you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Admiral Ed LeBlanc with Starfleet Intelligence. I understand you have the bodies of some of those killed in the clash with the pirates. Is this correct?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. Why would Starfleet Intelligence be investigating a theft? Sure it was a lot of money, but the Federation has A LOT more where that came from. They are in possession of the 10 biggest Latium nebulas in the quadrant.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Is one of them a female named Lita Kino?&rdquo; The admiral asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked to Mina who looked back at him just as confused.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; Ranma replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Good. We will be transporting her body to our ship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;May I ask why, Admiral?&rdquo; Ranma pondered already knowing the answer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You may ask.&rdquo; The admiral mused. &ldquo;However I have been ordered not to say anything. You know how it goes. Need to know and no one needs to know. To be honest I don&rsquo;t even know. Lately, I have just been S-I&rsquo;s transport bitch.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma laughed with the Admiral. &ldquo;Mousse, lower the shields and order the transporter chief to transport.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No need Captain. We have her now. Thank you. And as you may know, when doing dealing with S-I, this never happened.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What never happened?&rdquo; Ranma grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Thank you, Captain. See you around.&rdquo; The Admiral grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The screen went back to the exterior shot as the ship re-cloaked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Ranma mumbled. Seeing S-I around too often wasn&rsquo;t a good thing. It&rsquo;s kind of like too many police in your vicinity. Sure, you aren&rsquo;t doing anything wrong, but still.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The aft turbolift opened and Serena and Raye walked onto the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why was Lita transported off the ship?&rdquo; Raye fumed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina stood up. &ldquo;S-I wanted her.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What? Why?&rdquo; Serena bellowed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina just shrugged. Ranma walked to the back of the bridge. &ldquo;Who knows why S-I does anything they do. I am sure they have their reasons. Ours is not to question why ours is but to do and die.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to Shampoo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to assume that you have no interest in being apart of the memorial service?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo just crossed her arms. &ldquo;No interest is an understatement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma understood. &ldquo;Very well. You have the bridge.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo nodded her acknowledgment as she moved to the captain&rsquo;s chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked past the two female officers and into the lift. The doors closed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The service was scheduled to happen on deck 17, where the torpedo launchers were. The caskets were to be launched into space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift stopped on deck 10. The doors opened and Gosnell stepped in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Going to the service?&rdquo; Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell nodded. &ldquo;I knew her. She and I were &ndash; close.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma put his hand on his old friend&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. She&rsquo;s not there anymore though?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Gosnell asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Starfleet sent someone to take her body.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell shook his head. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Ranma replied. &ldquo;They just said they needed her body.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors opened deck 17 and the two walked out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she did what they say she did. I don&rsquo;t believe she could possibly have been involved in criminal activity.&rdquo; Gosnell paused. &ldquo;Well, maybe a little bit, but she would never hurt anyone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head. &ldquo;Shampoo was almost killed. Akane said that if she hadn&rsquo;t gotten treatment when she did she would have been dead.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not her.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stayed silent. It was obvious that his friend was hurting and he didn&rsquo;t want to make it any worse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Gosnell spoke up. &ldquo;Did you tell her?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Tell who what?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You know.&rdquo; Gosnell grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;WHAT?! NO!! I &ndash;&ldquo; Ranma cut himself off. He&rsquo;s hardly spoken two words to Akane since she got back. Well, outside of official business that is.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Tsk, Tsk Captain. I would think that this last mission would have made you realize that you may not always have a chance. Don&rsquo;t blunder like me and not say anything.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma realized why Gosnell was so adamant about him telling Akane his feelings. Could it be that Lita was the one that Gosnell didn&rsquo;t tell his feeling to?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell answered that question for him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s what happened. Maybe she just thought that no one loved her?&rdquo; Gosnell didn&rsquo;t really want that question answered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Gozz &ndash;&ldquo; Ranma said, stopping Gosnell. &ldquo;If a person has a good heart, they have a good heart. That can&rsquo;t change.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell started walking again without Ranma. &ldquo;Something sure as hell did.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">10 DAYS LATER &ndash; LOCATION UNKNOWN</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The room is very brightly lit. Not what you&rsquo;d expect from a Starfleet Intelligence room at all. It was a sickbay.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Admiral LeBlanc had just arrived. He just had Lita&rsquo;s body transported down. The door slid open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn around.&rdquo; A prissy female voice said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; The admiral replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Where was she?&rdquo; A raspy male voice asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;She was serving as the XO of the pirate ship that raided the Latium deposits.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A third voice spoke up. &ldquo;I need to examine her. If she&rsquo;s been in stasis we can save her. When she was blown out the breech she was flash frozen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What about the implant?&rdquo; The male voice asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously dysfunctional. She wasn&rsquo;t supposed to try and kill Starfleet Officers.&rdquo; The third voice replied. The man walked into the room. He was in a biohazard suit.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two others were still in the doorway. They could tell the admiral was becoming uneasy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I think I should leave before I hear more than I want to.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; The female said. &ldquo;You did a good job. I want you to keep an eye on the Sisko though. Her friends are on board and I don&rsquo;t want them to do anything to compromise the mission.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Any more than it has already been.&rdquo; The male finished. &ldquo;Last time we get anything from the Dominion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The admiral moved his position a little. &ldquo;What if they start investigating on their own?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo; The male said. &ldquo;Their captain is very by the book. He will keep them in line.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The admiral nods. &ldquo;LeBlanc to Roseville. Beam me up.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The admiral vanished in the usual pretty transporter effect.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The male and the female hop onto the exam table.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Lita.&rdquo; The female said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita&rsquo;s body let out a breath. She then started to breathe again. Her eyes opened.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; She whimpered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain it all later.&rdquo; The male replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Is the implant out?&rdquo; The female asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The medical tech nodded. &ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Her memories?&rdquo; The male asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Intact. &rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Damn.&rdquo; The female said. &ldquo;Poor child is going to have to deal with the guilt of what she did to her friends.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The male nodded. &ldquo;It will be a while before she&rsquo;ll be ready for another mission.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The female agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay with her. Get a hold of that useless Vorta and get our money back.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Gotcha.&rdquo; The male replied as he hopped down and left the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The tech turned to the table. &ldquo;I managed to repair most of the damaged parts of her brain. She still may have some aggressive tendencies. More than before the implant at least.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What &ndash; what did I do?&rdquo; Lita asked the female.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The female shook her head. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t you. You remember the photographic memory implant we gave you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita tried to nod, but she was still pretty weak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;For whatever reason, it fused with the part of your brain that controls your ethics and anger. It killed those parts. We then lost contact with you. The rest is, well history.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;My friends-&ldquo; Lita began to cry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fine, Lita. CB is with the Roseville and is going to keep an eye on them and may make contact with them if necessary.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I tried to kill Raye!&rdquo; Lita remembers, crying even more heavily.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The female sighed. &ldquo;I know it will take you a while to understand this, but it wasn&rsquo;t you. It was the implant.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita just closed her eyes and continued to cry. The female turned to the tech.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Make sure she gets some food. And when she&rsquo;s okay to return to her quarters let me and A know.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; The tech replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The female hoped off the table and walked out the door. Before the door closed she turned, took one last look at Lita, and shook her head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;For the Federation.&rdquo; She told herself. &ldquo;All for the protection of the Federation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She walked off. She only wished that she could honestly believe that it was worth all that they were doing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; text-align: justify;\">Things were changing. Maybe the term &lsquo;all costs&rsquo; needed to be removed from section 31 of the Federation Charter. It&rsquo;d be a shame if the people dedicated to its protection actually destroyed what they were protecting.</p>", "epilogue": true, "slug": "epilogue", "story": 1}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 10, "fields": {"chapter_number": 0, "title": "Intruder", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Ensign Ryouga Hibiki; personal log.

He never really set out to complain about the Sisko's Captain, Ranma Saotome in his log. However, that is what always seemed to happen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga stood and yawned. He walked over to his closet as he continued recording.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>I've gotten to spend a little bit more time with Akane. Ranma has been busy on the bridge, neglecting her. So usually after my daily jog I &ndash; eventually &ndash; work my way up to sickbay and say hello.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>I think I have been getting Akane to be more and more interested in me.

It will be perfect!</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"End recording,\" Ryouga instructed the computer. It chirped in compliance as Ryouga pulled a towel out of his closet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga was dressed in a pair of black running pants, running shoes, and a Starfleet Academy t-shirt. It was his daily exercise attire.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga got a lot of exercise as well. He frequently got lost on the ship and would end up running around the same corridors looking for the turbolifts.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">His directional misadventures led him to do his daily runs after his duty shift. He hated when Ranma scolded him, and he hated it, even more, when he was right to do so.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga had his mornings scheduled perfectly so that he would see Lt. Mousse walking down the corridor right when Ryouga opened his door. Normally Mousse would lead Ryouga to the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was assuming Mousse remembered his glasses.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Numerous female crewmembers have filed complaints thanks to Mousse mistaking the crewmember's name on the door label for the words 'Turbolift Four'.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga quickly stretched out his legs and went to his door. The doors hissed open and Ryouga quickly went out and began jogging down the corridor, hopefully towards the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, Turbolift Four was the other direction. Ryouga was headed right towards Turbolift Six &ndash; which goes straight down to the bowels of the ship.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bridge of the Gosnell class USS Benjamin Sisko was quiet. Patrolling the Cardassian Border was a quiet job.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma found it a boring job, which is why he spent the majority of his time in his ready room, either reading or napping.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Speaking of napping, Commander Shampoo was having a hard time not falling asleep in the plush Captain's chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was times like this that she knew why having her own command would be great. The chair had everything. Except for a cup holder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The remainder of the bridge was staffed by the usual people. Lt. Mousse, the ship's chief of Security and Tactical office stood behind the CONN. His eyes were scanning the console back and forth, looking for anything that resembled a ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The biggest thing he has seen so far was an asteroid.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lt. Commander Mina Aino sat at her operations station to the left of the helm. She kept a close eye on the ship's systems. Mousse eyed her every now and then because she would giggle. He couldn't quite figure out what about operations could be humorous. To him, it all seemed repetitive and dull.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina knew how to keep herself occupied. She had her terminal to terminal instant messaging system open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Down in the bottom of the ship, the Sisko's Chief Engineer sat in her little cubbyhole. Lt. Commander Serena Tsukino spent most of her duty time there. It seemed every time she tried to do anything in engineering she ended up in sickbay.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On days like this, there really wasn't much to do anyway. The ship had to remain at low battle alert, so heavy diagnostics couldn't be performed. And if something went wrong, the alerts would go off and some of the other people down there would start to scream.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">So Serena had nothing to do but chat with Mina over instant messenger.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>*buNNy (stsukino): I still can't believe you broke a bottle over his head!*</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>*oPsHoTtIe (maino): I had to make sure he wasn't a founder! People don't normally change like that!*</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>*buNNy (stsukino): It still makes me laugh. What did Raye say?*</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>*priestess (rhino): I said she's a boob and you're a klutz.*</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>*buNNy (stsukino): I may be a klutz, but at least my user name doesn't spell rhino.*</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the bridge, Mina began to laugh out loud. Loudly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo snapped to attention and looked around. She saw everyone was staring at Mina, who was desperately trying to regain her composure. Shampoo quickly wiped a small amount of sleep drool off of her mouth. Once she was sure that no one had realized that she had fallen asleep, she turned to Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Something wrong?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina bit her lip and turned to Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No ma'am.\" She squeaked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The officer manning the helm looked to his shipmate. Mina had tears welling up in her eyes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you okay?\" He asked her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded quickly and wiped her eyes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The turbolift doors to the bridge hissed open and Raye walked onto the bridge. She nodded to Shampoo and looked to Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina turned and saw Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hey.\" Raye smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina could no longer contain herself. She began to laugh again, falling out of her seat and to the deck in the process.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The smile on Raye's face dimmed. She scornfully looked at Mina rolling around on the carpeted floor of the bridge, laughing like a drunken Irishman at a Margaret Cho concert.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The entire bridge crew simply stared in shock at Mina's antics.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse scratched his head as he watched the ships third in command roll around. His attention diverted, he didn't see the sensor blips closing in on the Sisko.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sickbay!\" Ryouga instructed the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This turbolift does not stop at that deck. Would you like to be let off at the closest location?\" The computer asked him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh, sure,\" Ryouga replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The turbolift began to move down. Down wasn't actually the correct direction for Sickbay, but since Ryouga didn't know his right from left half the time, not knowing up from down was no big deal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ride took longer than it seemed like it should. The lift also didn't seem to change directions. It just went down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It finally stopped. The doors hissed open and Ryouga stepped out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The hallway was dark. There were some blue emergency lights along the top of the wall, but they were barely bright enough for Ryouga to see his hands, much less read the door panels.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It didn't seem to matter anyway because there didn't seem to be many doors.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga shrugged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Must be a power failure on this deck.\" He hypothesized.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga began walking down the poorly lit corridor, never looking behind him. If he had he would have seen the ship's computer core access room &ndash; located on deck 18. 14 decks below sickbay.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina had eventually pulled herself back up into her seat. The entire bridge crew continued to watch her get situated. It wasn't still Mousse's tactical panel began to chirp wildly that their attention was focused back on their jobs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Two ships, entering weapons range &ndash; they have a lock!\" Mousse stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo stood.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shields! Red alert! Captain to the bridge!\" Shampoo ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the ships fired on the Sisko. The ship shook slightly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shields holding.\" Mousse stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma burst out of his ready room and onto the bridge. Shampoo quickly moved out of the Captain's chair and into the XO's seat. She pulled up a tactical panel.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Status?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Two unidentified ships appeared and opened fire on us.\" Mousse replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hail them,\" Ranma ordered as Shampoo began to run a tactical analysis on the ships.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sisko shook slightly again as both of the ships opened fire on the Ranma's ship. He groaned and turned to Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No response, shields holding at 99 percent.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ai-yah. The ships have only phase cannons and minimal shielding.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded as the ships once again fired on the Sisko. He turned to Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Open a channel.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse complied and signaled when the channel was opened.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This is Captain Ranma Saotome of the Federation Starship Sisko. You are ordered to halt your attack and leave the area or you will be destroyed.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma's demand was answered with two more shots that bounced right off the Sisko's hull.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo no think they speak English.\" Shampoo mused.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma snickered and turned to Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lieutenant, target their shields. Fire when ready.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aye.\" Mousse complied. The Sisko's forward phaser banks lit up and struck the first ship. Her shields flickered and faded away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Target one's shields are down.\" Mousse informed Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second ship started to move. It flew up and above the much larger Federation ship. It then began to roll.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What it doing?\" Shampoo pondered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before anyone could come up with anything even close to an answer, the ship fired a green beam at the Sisko, which shook it hard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SHIELDS FAILING!\" Mina screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Shampoo asked no one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They're firing a power induction pulse that is overloading our power grid!\" Mina began to shout off systems that were failing. \"Engines going offline, shields are down, internal sensors are offline. Life support is beginning to be affected!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma spun around to Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Weapons?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse nodded. \"Still online.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Destroy them,\" Ranma ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse grinned and fired both phasers and torpedoes at the two ships. While the induction pulse seemed to be making short work of the Sisko, the two ships' defenses were no match for the battle cruiser's powerful weapons. Both ships were quickly destroyed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Damage?\" Ranma asked Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina checked her panel and then turned to the Captain.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nothing too serious as far as I can tell, sir. Shields are down due to EPS ruptures, but I am already beginning to reroute. They should be back up soon. Engines were forced into a restart, so warp and impulse are offline. Impulse should be back up within the hour, but the warp restart sequence takes about 12 hours.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sickbay is reporting minor injuries, nothing life-threatening,\" Mina added.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Also, internal sensors are offline, so until the damage control teams do a deck by deck I won't know much else.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma groaned. How did such little ships cause so many problems?</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga picked himself up off the deck and groaned. He wasn't quite sure what happened, but anytime he was thrown to the deck it pissed him off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>*Someone else doesn't know how to brake properly?*</em> Ryouga pondered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The blue emergency lights on the deck flickered and eventually shut off. They were quickly replaced with red, back-up emergency lighting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the?\" Ryouga said to no one as he moved down the corridor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Which way is engineering?\" A voice asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga thought about this for a minute. He didn't even know what deck he was on, much less how to get to engineering. He really didn't want anyone to know exactly how lost he was though, so he would just say that it was classified.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I think it's down this access hallway. We can climb up the computer core for the best surprise.\" A second voice asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Surprise?\" Ryouga whispered to himself. Ryouga wasn't quite sure what these two were up to, but he was pretty sure there was something not quite right about the way they were talking.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga moved into a corner as the two men came walking towards him. He disappeared into the darkness. The pair came walking past him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>*Cardassians?*</em> Ryouga silently asked himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The red lights formed a perfect silhouette of a pair of Cardassians walking down the corridor, both moving rather slowly, armed with rifles. Once the two intruders were past Ryouga and a good fifteen meters down the hall, Ryouga quietly moved across the hallway.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga tapped his communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ensign Hibiki to the bridge.\" He whispered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo looked to Ranma. \"Go ahead.\" She whispered back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander,\" Ryouga said as he slinked around the corner of the passageway, and into another indent in the wall. \"I just saw two armed Cardassians walking down the corridor.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo looked to Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I can't confirm.\" Mousse stated. \"Internal sensors are down, but they could have beamed over after our shields dropped and before the ships were destroyed.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What deck are you on?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga looked around and whimpered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't know.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma threw his arms into the air in frustration.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga.\" Shampoo stated. \"Can you look on one of the doors? Door labels say what deck you on.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga looked at a door he was standing near.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's too dark.\" He complained.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked to Mina. \"Are there any decks with power failures?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina checked her panel. \"Yeah, all of them have sections with no power.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ranma,\" Ryouga whispered. \"They were talking about accessing engineering. Something about climbing up through the computer core for the best surprise.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked over to Shampoo who was getting ready to bark off orders to Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They'd have to be on decks 17 or 18 if they are going up to engineering.\" Ranma pondered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo agree.\" She quickly spun around to Mousse. \"Get security teams down to decks 17 and 18 computer core area.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lieutenant, also send a couple of teams down to engineering, in case they get there before your teams can intercept them,\" Ranma added.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aye.\" Mousse complied. \"It would help me out if I knew EXACTLY where they were.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked to Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Any luck on getting the internal sensors online?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shook her head. \"I'm sorry sir. Damage control teams can't seem to pinpoint exactly where the problem is.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighed as he sat down in his chair. \"I guess it's up to Ryouga to lead us to them.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Ryouga's voice grumbled.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena yawned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the attack, Mina's been too busy to chat with her. She had offered to help the damage control teams.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Thirty minutes ago...</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I can help,\" Serena whined. \"Here, give me that plasma torch. I'm going to go fix the EPS manifold on deck nine.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena snatched the torch from two terrified engineers and ran off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Fifteen minutes later...</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"FIRE SUPPRESSION TEAMS TO DECK NINE! DAMAGE CONTROL TEAMS TO DECK NINE. MEDICAL EMERGENCY TO DECK NINE!\" Bellowed over the ship's communication system.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two engineers who had their torch taken from them sighed, grabbed some repair gear, and wandered off in the direction of deck nine.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Back to now...</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena scratched the area that Akane had repaired on her arm. Seems a plasma fire burns very hot. Thank goodness the technology was good enough not to give her a nasty scar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors to main engineering slid open with a loud hiss. Serena turned to see who it was.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thirty security officers walked into the area.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You three, take upper engineering. You three, lower. Everyone else, pair up and cover every entrance.\" The senior guard ordered. The officers all nodded and took off in their assigned directions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Who's in charge down here?\" The lead officer shouted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the engineers pointed to Serena who was cowering in her cubby hole.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guard walked over to Serena. He looked at her for a moment. Serena looked as if she was expecting a tornado or a nuclear attack. You know, duck and cover?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh- Commander?\" The officer half asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah?\" Serena whimpered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's wrong?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You're coming to get me. I told Mousse that I didn't mean to start that fire!\" She cried.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The security officer thought about this for a minute, and then outstretched his hand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ma'am, I'm not here to get you. I'm here to protect you. We have intruders on board and we think they may be on their way here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena looked to the guard. He nodded at her reassuringly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay.\" Serena sniffled. She took the officer's hand as he helped her to her feet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once Serena was upright, she looked around. She noticed all the guards were ready to shoot the first thing that looked at them funny.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The police on this ship didn't mess around.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What do you need us to do?\" Serena asked the guard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you able to disable the master control override?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena cocked her head like a confused puppy. \"The what?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guard then cocked his head in the same manner. Surely the chief engineer knew what the master control override was.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Um, Commander?\" An engineer piped up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes?\" Serena asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We can disable it, but we have to do it manually from inside the Jeffries tube.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well then,\" Serena stated, sounding as official as she possibly could. \"Make it so.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am.\" The engineer replied. He grabbed a couple of other engineers and went off with them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Um, I should go with them.\" The guard stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena looked at him, her big blue eyes bearing down on his very soul.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'd feel better if you stayed with me,\" Serena said, this time in a rather seductive voice.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">*Gulp* \"Jenkins! Stone! Go with those engineers, keep them safe!\" The head security officer yelled, without ever taking his attention away from Serena.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jenkins and Stone did as they were told. Some of the other engineers stopped what they were doing and looked at Serena and the dumbstruck guard staring at each other.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Not again.\" One of them noted.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga tip-toed down the darkened corridor about fifteen meters behind the uninvited Cardassian intruders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga was happy that he was wearing running shoes and not his uniform boots. The soft soles made it easy to silently move across the metal deck plating that made up the floor of the lower utility decks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two Cardassians stopped and looked at their map.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The computer core should be down this corridor.\" One of them stated while pointing to his left.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Excellent.\" The other acknowledged. \"Once we get into the core, I will proceed up to engineering with the bomb while you program in the false sensor data.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes sir. That way when the Federation comes across the debris of the ship they will think Central Cardassian Government destroyed it, and not us fringe extremists!\" The first continued.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Therefore starting a new war with Cardassia Prime! Then, while that is happening our group can seize power!\" The second concluded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pair cackled for a moment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You know, do you think it was necessary for us to reveal our plans out loud?\" The first Cardassian pondered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Who the hell cares? There's no one down here.\" The second stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pair start laughing again as they turn and head down the final corridor, towards the Sisko's computer core.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I can't wait for security,\" Ryouga whispered to himself. \"I have got to stop them before they reach the computer core.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga nodded to himself and maneuvered himself into the corridor. He eyed his two targets.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">*Phase rifles. I will have to disarm them.* Ryouga looked around. He noticed a metal bolt on the deck that had been jarred loose during the attack. He quickly darted over and grabbed it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Cardassians soon arrived at the door to the computer core. The first one hit a couple of buttons. The door just buzzed at them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The attack must have sealed the door.\" He noted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second pulled a small device out of his pocket. He placed it on the door, where the two sides met.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Duck.\" He stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pair dove to the ground. The device beeped twice and exploded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the smoke had cleared the pair observed that the door had been blown open, but only by a small amount.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We can't fit through there.\" The second Cardassian complained.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, help me pull it open.\" The first grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two Cardassians placed their rifles on the deck and started to pull on either part of the door. It slowly began to budge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">*I have to make my move now.* Ryouga thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga took the bolt he had picked up and threw it to the left of the Cardassians. It hit the ground with a clang.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two Cardassians looked over to where the bolt fell. They both bent down to pick up their rifles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"NOT ON MY WATCH!\" Ryouga cried out and he came flying at them. The two Cardassians screamed as Ryouga managed to kick them both in the head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga's forward momentum though sent him slamming into, and through the door, the Cardassians were trying to open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few moments passed with both the Cardassians on the deck knocked out, and Ryouga, in the computer control room &ndash; also knocked out. Eventually, the three began to regain consciousness.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Dammit,\" Ryouga grumbled. He looked up as he rubbed his head. He saw the Cardassians begin to move.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The guns!\" He squeaked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga jumped through the doorways and kicked the guns down the deck plating.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two Cardassians stood. One wiped some blood off of his face and grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You think we need guns to fight?\" He taunted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Bring it on, Spoon-head.\" Ryouga slandered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Spoon-head?\" The second asked. \"That's racist.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It really is.\" The first agreed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Is that the kind of example you want to set as a Federation officer?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga bowed his head in shame. \"I'm sorry.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sucker.\" The first grinned as his partner charged Ryouga.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga looked up in just enough time to see the Cardassian's elbow slammed into his face.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga flew backward and hit the deck. Not one to be phased by being hit in the head, Ryouga hopped right back up and took up a fighting stance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You're a tough one!\" The second Cardassian acknowledged as he charged again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga was ready for him this time and easily dodged his attack. Ryouga spun and punched the Cardassian in the back as he went past Ryouga.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Cardassian hit the ground and winced in pain. Ryouga picked him up and threw him back into his partner. The two crashed into the wall behind them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two Cardassians slowly returned to their feet. Ryouga grinned and cracked his knuckles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Time to finish you two off.\" Ryouga glowed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Wait!\" The first Cardassian whimpered. \"We surrender!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Not on my watch!\" Ryouga laughed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Stop saying that!\" The second Cardassian groaned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"BAKUSAI TENKETSU!\" Ryouga screamed as he charged the two intruders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" A voice yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga's finger came down, closer to the deck plating. Seconds from impact.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">*POKE!*</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Wha?' Ryouga pondered. He looked down to see Mousse's head in between his finger and the deck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mousse?\" Ryouga asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse hopped right up and began to flail his arms.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?!?\" He screamed. \"YOU'LL DESTROY HALF THIS DECK!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga growled and began to yell back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WELL IT SURE AS HELL TOOK YOUR PEOPLE LONG ENOUGH TO GET HERE! WHAT DID YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WELL MAYBE IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH A LOST IDIOT YOU'D HAVE KNOWN WHERE YOU WERE!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga and Mousse continued to yell at each other. The two Cardassians attempted to use this as their chance to escape. They turned and began to walk down the corridor away from the two screaming officers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ahem.\" Ranma cleared his throat. The two Cardassians looked up from their sneaking and right into the business end of six phasers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The six security officers standing next to Ranma quickly took the two intruders into custody. Ranma walked over to where Ryouga and Mousse were now rolling around on the floor fighting with each other.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Excuse me, Lieutenant, Ensign,\" Ranma stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pair ignored their commanding officer and continued to fight.

I just &ndash; well you know.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane shook her head. He WAS going to say it and it was going to be on her terms. \"No, I don't know.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma groaned. This was a lot easier when he practiced on the EMH. The EMH even seemed a little less awkward even though he was male.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm not good at expressing my feelings. You should understand. You are the same way.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane nodded in silent agreement.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So.\" Ranma paused. The words were on the tip of his tongue. He knew what he wanted to say. He had the words. He had rehearsed this moment for the last six weeks. What the hell was wrong with him?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma knew that if he didn't say he'd seem even more stupid than he would if he did say it. He knew she felt the same way about him. Gosnell and he had gone over it hundreds of times.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma would rather Akane say it first, but he knew it wasn't her way. He was going to have to be a man. He was going to have to be the one who says it first. He would have this day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane &ndash;\" Ranma started. \"I lo-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">His communicator chirped.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Saotome here,\" Ranma replied almost a little too anxiously.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nihao Ranma! Ship getting distress call! Explosion in dilithium matrix!&nbsp;Ship need help! We closest!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Set a course. I'm on my way.\" Ranma replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He looked to Akane who was fuming. \"Excuse me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma darted out of the ready room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane just sat there. \"Shampoo. It's ALWAYS Shampoo!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane got up and went around to the other side of the desk. She started punching things into Ranma's computer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Computer, request medical information system. How can the CMO relieve a bridge officer from duty and have her confined somewhere?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer began to spit information up onto the display. Akane at first just grinned. She then began to laugh. Then, much to her own surprise and chagrin, she burst into full Kuno style cackle.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She stopped, cleared her throat, and walked out of the ready room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once on the bridge, she took a look around. Sitting at his helm station was Ryouga.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once he noticed that Akane was looking at him he blushed and gave her one of those &lsquo;I'm a little wimp who won't tell you I love you because I turn into the little pig you've been sleeping with and loving it even more since you started to sleep naked' waves. Akane waved back oblivious to Ryouga's embarrassment. What else was new though?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next to Ryouga at the Operations station, she made note of Lt. Commander Mina Aino. She's cute. Akane thought. But Ranma doesn't really care for blondes so I am good there. I think.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Swinging back a little, to the captain's left was Lt. Commander Raye Hino.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane thought she was pretty and she didn't really trust her after the incident in 10-Forward, but she seemed more interested in Ranma's girl half than anything else. Akane chose not to worry. The likelihood of Ranma getting wet onboard was slim to none.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As Akane checked out the next station her stomach growled. Shampoo bugged her THAT much. Also could have been the 3 chili cheese dogs she had for lunch, but she was content on blaming it on Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Behind the captain's chair was the tactical station where Mousse was stationed. Surprisingly he's been pretty good at that station. Once Ranma duct-taped his glasses around his head that is. At first, Ranma got a little bit too carried away with it and put the duct tape over his nose and eyes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane had gotten pretty good are resuscitating people though, so all was good.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the back wall of the bridge, there were several other miscellaneous stations staffed by people whose names were not really important. Akane figured that if they didn't say anything they weren't important enough to have names.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane noted that Ranma was standing in the middle of the bridge. He appeared to be chatting with someone on the main viewer. She assumed that it was the captain of the distressed ship. They appeared to be discussing what was wrong with his ship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"-you could let us borrow a couple of engineers and some dilithium we should be able to get underway to a starbase within a couple of hours.\" The man on the viewer finished.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No problem,\" Ranma replied. \"Glad to help. We should be there within the hour. Were there any serious injuries?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Eh, some plasma burns. But we have a medical staff. They just didn't bother giving us any engineers.\" He replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded but was confused. \"What kind of mission are you on that you have more medical staff than engineers?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man appeared to be looking at someone on the starboard side of the bridge. He then turned back to Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The nature of our mission is classified. We picked up what appeared to be a Cardassian patrol ship within 10 light-years, so we moved into the nebula to avoid detection. We should have figured that a super-neutrino nebula wouldn't be good for us.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma laughed with the captain. \"No. Usually isn't.\" Ranma let a couple of more chuckles out then continued. \"As I said, we will be there within the hour with any assistance you might need.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thanks again, Captain Saotome. Minneapolis out.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The screen went back to the starfield at warp effect. Akane looked over to Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Walk to engineering with me?\" Ranma asked her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane nodded. As she walked toward the turbolift she could feel Shampoo's eyes burning a hole in the back of her neck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift opened and the two got in. As she turned around she could verify that Shampoo was staring at her.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the door closed Akane left something for Shampoo to remember her by.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A finger.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know which one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift began its way down. Ranma smiled at Akane. \"That wasn't very nice.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane grinned back. \"I'm not very nice. You should know that by now.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma couldn't disagree with that.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two rode the lift for a while in silence till Akane decided to ask a question.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don't you think that there is a whole hell of a lot of classified doings going on lately?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma hadn't really thought about it, but she was right. Two incidents of anything normally wouldn't be counted as suspicious, but when it's classified then it reeks of Starfleet Intelligence. Even classified, most information about missions is allowed to be given to a ship's captain, especially those coming to assist the classified ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, when S-I is involved no one knows anything, and if they do it's usually useless information that you could get from the Federation News Service.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You're right,\" Ranma responded. \"I sure as hell hope we're not getting ourselves caught in the middle of something.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors of the lift slid open and Akane and Ranma found themselves in engineering. Ranma grinned when he saw his Chief Engineer giving a speech to her crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He lost his grin though when he got into earshot.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"-and the girl said &lsquo;that's not my belly button!\" All of the crew that didn't notice the captain laughed. The ones who did just stood there, trying to slowly back away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena noticed the ones who weren't laughing. \"What's wrong guys? Don't you get it? It wasn't her belly button it was her-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander.\" Ranma interrupted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena spun around. She nearly screamed when she saw it was Ranma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain! Hi!\" She said with a smile.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The slacker engineers who were listening to Serena's joke all scrambled like cockroaches after the lights have been turned on. Serena frowned at her lack of backup.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane just shook her head. Ranma decided to let it go.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander, I need you to assemble an engineering team of you and three people to beam over to a ship and fix a burnt-out dilithium matrix.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena looked confused. \"Do what in the who now?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane turned away so her snicker wouldn't be noticeable to Serena.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Just assemble a team and report to transporter room one in 45 minutes please,\" Ranma instructed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes sir.\" Serena smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma and Akane proceeded to leave engineering as Serena made a pretty feeble attempt to bark orders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She's cute,\" Akane said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Eh. I don't care much for blondes.\" Ranma replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane smiled and let out a silent \"Yes!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A COOL, SEMI PLAGIARIZED STAR TREK TYPE THEME SHOULD BE INSERTED HERE, THIS TIME ONE WITH WORDS LIKE ON ENTERPRISE!

Once Shampoo had broken up the argument, Ranma started to admire the ship on his view screen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The USS Minneapolis was a nice ship. Brand new. It was a class that wasn&rsquo;t very familiar to Ranma. Bullwinkle-Class.

He&rsquo;d also heard that the crew quarters were designed to be more comfortable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The more Ranma thought about it the more he realized this ship was the same kind of ship that he had an encounter with six weeks ago.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma had also heard that it was equipped with a cloaking device, but that could neither be confirmed nor denied by Starfleet.

Just to make sure that they could counter her &ndash; for lack of a better word &ndash; incompetence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighed as he read the performance reports of her team.

He shielded the panel from the others and punched in some numbers. He then put his eye up to the retina checker. The computer chirped at him and the doors slid open. Inside there was no one in the room except for two-uniformed security officers. There was also one other person who wasn&rsquo;t in a uniform, but he did have a Starfleet communicator on his shirt. He noticed the group and stood up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff motioned for the engineering crew to go inside. He stood in the doorway.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Just let these officers know when you are finished. You will also have to inform them if you need anything off of your ship. Communication off the ship isn&rsquo;t possible, except through secure channels,&rdquo; Staff said before he smiled and walked away, the doors closing with a chirp behind him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man who wasn&rsquo;t in uniform smiled at the group.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Greetings. I&rsquo;m Commander Chronister. Let me show you where the problem is.&rdquo; He smiles as the group follows him across a catwalk and to the warp core.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The warp core was one of a new design. There was the normal large centerpiece, but it was bigger. There appeared to be two dilithium chambers and two central cores. The warp core was dark and appeared to be offline.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with the catwalk?&rdquo; Devall asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister doesn&rsquo;t turn to the group. &ldquo;We use experimental energy in the warp core to power some of the basic systems of the ship. For it to work the core cannot touch any metal on the ship. Since we have the core offline right now we can extend the catwalk to come in contact with the core.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Devall was fascinated. He loved hearing about new technologies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to be nosey, just engineer&rsquo;s curiosity, but what would happen if the catwalk was extended while the warp core was online?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister stopped. &ldquo;Not sure, but it&rsquo;s so important that it doesn&rsquo;t happen that I assume it would be very bad.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Devall nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The group got to the warp core. Chronister leaned back against the wall surrounding it. Devall looked to Chronister.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;This is going to take a while.&rdquo; He looked inside the dilithium chamber in question. &ldquo;There is some major damage in here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister nodded and hit his comm badge. He relayed the information to someone unknown.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena&rsquo;s ears perked up. The voice sounded familiar but she thought nothing of it and began to help the others.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Captain&rsquo;s log: supplemental. It&rsquo;s been six hours since I sent the engineering crew over to the Minneapolis to assist in repairs. So far I haven&rsquo;t heard a word from them. I attempted to contact Commander Tsukino to no avail. I am preparing to hail the captain and see what&rsquo;s going on.</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turns to Mousse. &ldquo;Hail them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse complies. The captain of the Minneapolis appears on the screen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes, Captain?&rdquo; He says.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He appears to Ranma to have the attitude like Ranma was inconveniencing him. If there was anything Ranma hated that was someone copping an attitude with him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I was just wanting the status on my crew. They have been over there for over six hours.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yeah, sorry about that. The repairs are taking longer than we expected.&rdquo; The Captain replied. He seemed to be agitated that the repairs were taking as long as they did.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. Why aren&rsquo;t I able to contact them?&rdquo; Ranma queried</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Communications off the ship are only capable from approved stations. If you want I will have your chief engineer contact you with a status report.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma&rsquo;s distrust in this guy was growing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;d be nice, thanks.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man nodded and the communication was terminated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma spun around. &ldquo;Can you scan them?&rdquo; He asked Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse shook his head. &ldquo;No. They have some sort of weird hull plating that makes scans of the interior impossible.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma plopped into his seat. What the hell was on that ship that they didn&rsquo;t want anyone to know about?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina chirped in. &ldquo;Sir? Are you aware that the Minneapolis isn&rsquo;t listed in Starfleet&rsquo;s ship inventory?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;I am now. This must be an S-I ship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse&rsquo;s panel chirped.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Commander Tsukino is hailing us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. &ldquo;On screen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena appeared on the viewscreen and waved at Mina and Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye just shook her head while Mina waved back and smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Commander. How are things going?&rdquo; Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Slow,&rdquo; Serena replied. &ldquo;We are having to rebuild the entire dilithium chamber.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you contact us and have us send you one?&rdquo; Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;They say anything we replicate won&rsquo;t be compatible,&rdquo; Serena replied. &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t be too much longer. They want us off of here as much as we want to finish.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. &ldquo;Very well. If you are going to be longer than another hour let me know.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena nodded and the transmission is ended.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye turns to Ranma. &ldquo;Did you see that guy standing over her shoulder?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. His head was getting tired from all of the nodding.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yeah, I did.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye realized that Ranma didn&rsquo;t see her point. &ldquo;Did you also notice that&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">he wasn&rsquo;t wearing a uniform?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma didn&rsquo;t notice that. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye continued. &ldquo;I also noticed that there was no one else in the area. She was obviously in engineering but I didn&rsquo;t see a warp core or anything! No monitors that were on, no engineers, nothing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma&rsquo;s mind was already in suspicious mode but Raye&rsquo;s observations just sent it into overdrive. He looks to Mina and motions for her to go to his ready room. &ldquo;You too, Counselor.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The three walk into his ready room. Ranma hops on to his desk while the other two have a seat on his couch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been scanning this sector for days. I want you to research the log files and tell me if you see anything strange. I also want you to find this &lsquo;Cardassian patrol ship&rsquo; that &lsquo;forced&rsquo; them into the nebula.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I really do not like not knowing what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; Ranma concluded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye and Mina nodded and left the room to get to work on their project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma hit his communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Mousse &ndash; I want you to do a very long-range scan. Find me a Cardassian ship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo; Mousse replied. &ldquo;But from everything I have seen in Starfleet security reports every Cardassian ship has been either dismantled for spare parts or is assigned to provide security to Cardassia Prime and their colonies. There aren&rsquo;t any Cardassian colonies in this sector.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought too, Mousse. Try anyway.&rdquo; Ranma answered dryly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; Mousse replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma wasn&rsquo;t a happy guy. He slid across his desk and plopped down into his seat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Computer. Get me, Admiral Saotome.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena groaned. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong now?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Devall turned to her. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get the rebuilt processor to line up correctly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The plain-clothed Chronister walked up and looked into the chamber. He then checked something on his PADD and cocked his head. &ldquo;Oh &ndash; it&rsquo;s not supposed to line up evenly.&rdquo; He scratched his head, unsure why it shouldn&rsquo;t, but the diagrams don&rsquo;t lie.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Devall and Serena just looked at him. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Devall asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man shrugged and cleared his throat. &ldquo;Just the way it is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Devall rolled his eyes. &ldquo;I could have built a new warp core easier than this.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena laughed. Chronister did not.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I need to contact Captain Saotome. It&rsquo;s been two hours. He wanted me to call him after one hour.&rdquo; Serena informed the man.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister motioned for one of the security officers guarding the door to come over and take his place as he and Serena walked back across the catwalk.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Devall turned to one of the Sisko&rsquo;s engineers. &ldquo;I think they are expecting us to steal something.&rdquo; The engineer just chuckled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister took Serena out of the warp core room and sat down at the computer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Computer - verify.&rdquo; He stuck his eye up to the retina scanner. The computer chirped that everything was okay. &ldquo;Hail the Sisko.&rdquo; The computer complied and Shampoo appeared on the viewer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena sat down at the console. &ldquo;Commander, where is the Captain?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;In meeting.&rdquo; Shampoo replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister began to shift uncomfortably. The captain of a ship doesn&rsquo;t usually have a meeting without his first officer unless something is up. He hits his communicator and whispers something.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; Serena continues. &ldquo;We should be done in a few minutes. Rebuilding something as complex as a dilithium chamber is hard enough, but when it&rsquo;s a new breed and they won&rsquo;t give you schematics it becomes twice as hard.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena made her frustrations known to Chronister.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo nods. &ldquo;Understand. Signal when ready to go.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena nods and the transmission ended.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena stands up but the man blocks her path. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t their business that the chamber is of a new design. Please don&rsquo;t provide that kind of information again.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena backs up slightly. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister turns and takes her back and through the doors.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Commander,&rdquo; Devall calls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re finished. I think.&rdquo; He grumbles shooting a not-so-friendly look at Chronister and then to the security guard breathing down his neck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The group walks off the catwalk. Chronister retracts the catwalk and then hits a few buttons. The warp core lights up and starts to do its normal pulsing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Excellent. Many thanks.&rdquo; Chronister says. He motions to the security officers. &ldquo;Please take them back to the transporter room.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They nod an acknowledgment and hurry the group off. Chronister hits his comm badge again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;JC to CB. They&rsquo;re leaving.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Finally. Shit.&rdquo; CB replies. &ldquo;Is the cloak fixed?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Chronister answered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Good. Once they are off the ship reengage the cloak.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Right in front of the Sisko?&rdquo; Chronister asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;They know we have a cloak. That moron Leblanc decloaked right in front of them when they retrieved LK.&rdquo; CB grumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the boss,&rdquo; Chronister replied, closing the communication.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;As soon as they are on board &ndash;&ldquo; Ranma ordered, storming back onto the bridge. &ldquo;I want them ALL in my ready room.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo acknowledge as she ran off to the transporter room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ryouga!&rdquo; Ranma bellowed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here!&rdquo; Ryouga bellowed back. &ldquo;No need for dramatics.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma just ignored him. &ldquo;I want you to get us back on our patrol course. I don&rsquo;t want them to think ANYTHING is amiss.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga rolled his eyes and complied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga had actually gotten good at his job over the last few weeks. While they were in dry dock he went down to Starfleet HQ and spent hours in the flight simulator. Once he actually caused the simulator to self-destruct. Not a self-destruct simulation, but actually caused the simulator to blow up. Starfleet is still trying to explain it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After that, though, he had gotten really good at his piloting skills. Since then he had only gotten them lost once. Granted they had only been on two missions, but 50 percent was pretty damned good for him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">All he had to do now was work on navigating around the ship without ending up in a torpedo tube.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma kept his eye on the view screen. He was waiting for that little wavy ship cloaking effect. It hadn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was all he needed to confirm his suspicion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That ship worked for Section 31.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">EARLIER</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Figure anything out?&rdquo; Ranma asked Mina and Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Actually we tried to answer two questions and ended up with about thirty,&rdquo; Raye answered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Check this out.&rdquo; Mina punched something into the conference room&rsquo;s computer. A map of Cardassian space appeared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye stood up and went to the map. &ldquo;This is a map of Cardassian space we got from Starfleet listening stations along the border.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;The range is 70 light-years into their space. Notice anything missing?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma saw the point. &ldquo;Ships?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded. She pointed out a tiny little blip in the far upper left-hand corner of the screen. &ldquo;We found one. A Romulan cargo ship carrying medical supplies to Cardassia Prime.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye continued. &ldquo;Cardassia has been buying medical supplies from anyone possible since the Dominion nearly wiped out the entire population of Cardassia Prime.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina took her turn. &ldquo;The Romulan ship entered from Romulan space about 42 light-years away from Federation space.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Ranma concluded. &ldquo;There was no Cardassian scout ship that they would be hiding from.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mina answered. &ldquo;Also, this nebula that they went into was not neutrino-based. It&rsquo;s just lithium gas and a little electromagnetic dust.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We could float someone through in an environmental suit and they&rsquo;d be fine.&rdquo; Raye finished.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Wonderful.&rdquo; Ranma groaned.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma wanted an easy explanation to this, but of course, there wasn&rsquo;t any. And as usual, his father was useless.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shampoo to Ranma.&rdquo; The intercom called out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes Commander,&rdquo; Ranma replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Away team ready to come back.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stood and walked to the door as the two investigators followed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Understood. I want you to meet them in the transporter room.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He and the two ladies stormed out onto the bridge.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma continued to stare at the viewscreen. Mousse was the first on the bridge to speak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ranma. The away team is on board. The Captain of the Minneapolis is hailing us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma acknowledged Mousse. &ldquo;On screen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The captain of the Minneapolis appeared. &ldquo;Thank you for your help, Captain Saotome. Our dilithium chamber is good as new. Kudos to your team.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Someone from off-screen cleared their throat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Oh, if I may ask, why did you contact Starfleet Command?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma smiled. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no activity out here. Just trying to see if we could get a new assignment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Minneapolis captain smiled back. &ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head no. &ldquo;Apparently they like wasting resources.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The captain laughed. &ldquo;Sounds like the admiralty. Take care and be safe. Minneapolis out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just prior to the connection being closed a man in plain clothes, a different one than before, walked across the back of the Minneapolis&rsquo; bridge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye stood right up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;DARIEN?&rdquo; She screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man turned toward the viewscreen as the connection closed. The ship turned, warped off, and out of view.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned around. &ldquo;Can you-&ldquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse interrupted him. &ldquo;They cloaked once they got a light-year away.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;A LIGHT YEAR?&rdquo; Ranma exclaimed. &ldquo;How fast were they going?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina checked her panel. &ldquo;9.95.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse looked as surprised as Ranma. &ldquo;Cloak that works at that speed?&rdquo; Mousse mumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked to Raye. &ldquo;Did you know that man?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye looked to Mina and then to Ranma. &ldquo;I think so? But &ndash; he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked to Mina. She shook her head. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t really paying attention.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to Mousse. &ldquo;Send the visual recordings of the transmission from the Minneapolis to the conference room.&rdquo; He looked to Mina and Raye who knew what they had to do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Make sure you scan all the faces to see if they match anyone in the database.&rdquo; Mina nods and the two girls walk into the conference room as Serena and the engineering team, escorted by Shampoo, walked onto the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma motioned for all of them to follow him into his ready room. &ldquo;Mousse &ndash; you&rsquo;ve got the bridge.&rdquo; Mousse acknowledged but chose to stay at his station instead of sitting in the captain&rsquo;s chair. Mousse really wasn&rsquo;t interested in command. He just wanted to fight.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inside Ranma&rsquo;s ready room Ranma had Serena sit in the chair just across from his desk. The other engineers sat down on his couch while Shampoo stood beside him behind his desk.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Anything &ndash; weird &ndash; happen over there?&rdquo; Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena could just laugh. &ldquo;It would have been weird for something that wasn&rsquo;t weird to happen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Explain.&rdquo; Shampoo ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Tell him, JC.&rdquo; Serena said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC cleared his throat. &ldquo;Their chamber wasn&rsquo;t damaged by a dilithium explosion.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;So what did it?&rdquo; Shampoo asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;An overload of neurons.&rdquo; Serena retorted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC stepped up next to Serena. &ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be anything on a Federation starship that would have neurons. Normally.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Normally?&rdquo; Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC nodded and motioned for the captain&rsquo;s computer. Ranma nodded and JC began to bring something up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;These are the schematics for a high-speed cloaking device.&rdquo; JC pointed out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been interested in cloaking technology so I had a Romulan engineer friend of mine that I met at a conference during the war send me the beta schematics.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC pointed some parts out on the schematic and continued. &ldquo;Now, this isn&rsquo;t the OFFICIAL schematics because those would be classified to us, due to the treaty that banned Federation cloaking technology. But it does show the basics.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Included how it&rsquo;s powered.&rdquo; Ranma guessed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC nodded. &ldquo;Neuronic energy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Very unstable!&rdquo; Shampoo noted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC nodded to her. &ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am. I realized what was up when I took my first integrity scan and detected the neurons. Plus the fact the warp core has to be completely ungrounded.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Ungrounded?&rdquo; Ranma asked. He wasn&rsquo;t even sure that was a word.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;For lack of a better term,&rdquo; Serena answered. &ldquo;The warp core cannot come in contact with any of the ship. It&rsquo;s held in place by a gravity field.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;So the Federation did get their hands on a high-speed cloak,&rdquo; Ranma concluded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; JC replied. &ldquo;Apparently not officially though.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. &ldquo;So what caused the explosion?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC thought about it for a second. &ldquo;If they do have this type of cloaking device, I would say a power overload that fed back into the dilithium chamber.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Like a phaser shot?&rdquo; Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo looked at Ranma for a second. She was trying to figure out what Ranma was thinking. &ldquo;Anyway to track them?&rdquo; Shampoo finally asked the engineers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC shook his head. &ldquo;A normal warp core will leave a plasma and ionization trail. This warp core leaves more of a proton warp trail.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;And the concentration of protons in open space is so heavy that sorting out a proton warp trail would be like trying to get pee out of a swimming pool.&rdquo; Serena finished.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stuck his tongue out at Serena&rsquo;s analogy. &ldquo;Thank you. If we need any more information we will get a hold of you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC and Serena nodded in acknowledgment and walked out of the ready room with the rest of the engineering team. Ranma turned to Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo shook her head. &ldquo;Secrets never good.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma agreed. &ldquo;I find it hard to believe that an S-I ship would&nbsp; just have an explosion that would make them that vulnerable.&rdquo; Ranma stood up and the two walked onto the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">At about the same time Raye and Mina walked out of the conference room. Neither of them looked happy. In fact, it almost appeared that Raye had been crying.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Commander?&rdquo; Ranma asked Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;It was him.&rdquo; Mina frowned. &ldquo;The other man, the one who was with Serena in engineering is someone we don&rsquo;t know, but the Federation database lists both of them as being deceased.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighed as he dropped down into his chair. He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure what to do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He looked at the rest of the bridge crew. They were looking at him for instructions. He didn&rsquo;t have any though. It seemed obvious to him that the trail had gone cold. If they couldn&rsquo;t track down the ship then they couldn&rsquo;t get any answers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He sighed again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Well, guess we will just run our patrol course.&rdquo; Ranma shrugged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;But Captain &ndash;&ldquo; Raye started.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked at her. She didn&rsquo;t even really need a response because she knew what it was going to be.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;There is nothing we can do,&rdquo; Ranma informed Raye of what was more than obvious to her. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone. It&rsquo;s obvious that they are part of Starfleet Intelligence, and as we all know they have their own agenda.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nodded but continued anyway. &ldquo;What if they have some illegal detainees? Like Darien!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighed once again. &ldquo;If you have a plan I&rsquo;d love to hear it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye just sat there.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She didn&rsquo;t have any more of an idea of what to do next than Ranma did. She didn&rsquo;t like not having any options and she didn&rsquo;t like knowing that Darien was alive even though she was at his funeral.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She personally reviewed the autopsy reports.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She saw his body.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She touched it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She cried over it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She visited his grave every time she possibly could.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why would anyone go through so much trouble to fake a death? What was going on?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She wanted answers damn it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She knew though that the only person who had the answers she wanted was gone. Long gone. Warp 9.95 will get you anywhere fast.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She continued to stare at the stars streaking by. She was happy he was alive but things were certainly simpler when he was dead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But he wasn&rsquo;t dead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thought of the endless possibilities of what happened started to make her head hurt. Maybe if she got some sleep she would be able to think better.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She realized that going to sleep was the only good idea she had.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Captain?&rdquo; She turned to Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;May I go to my quarters? I&rsquo;m not feeling so hot.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. &ldquo;See Commander Tendo if you think you may be coming down with something.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nodded. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s just this.&rdquo; She flailed her arms toward the viewscreen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Ranma replied. &ldquo;Take the rest of the day off. I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye smiled and walked off the bridge and into the lift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the door slid closed Ranma walked over to Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s your friend. You know her better than I or anyone else here would. Check on her after your shift please.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded. &ldquo;Her and Darien &ndash; &ldquo; Mina cut herself off for a second and then continued.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Darien was the man we saw on the bridge. They were close.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. He assumed that from how she reacted to seeing him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina looked back to Ranma who was returning to his seat. &ldquo;Captain?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;He and Serena were even closer. It&rsquo;d be in her best interest that for now, we didn&rsquo;t mention this to her.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma made one quick nod with his head as Mina turned back to her station and resumed her scanning of the border.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to Shampoo who was playing some sort of computer game.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo; Ranma queried.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo, unsure of whether or not she was in trouble, sheepishly shrugged. &ldquo;I think Ranma father put it on here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma just shrugged and turned back to the almost hypnotic motion of the stars at warp. He wanted a game to play.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "questions", "story": 3}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 13, "fields": {"chapter_number": 2, "title": "Memories", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister walked onto the bridge of the Minneapolis. The bridge was about the same layout as a defiant class bridge. There were a couple of stations that were refitted for the Minneapolis' assignment, but it was more or less the same.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Minneapolis was a defiant class ship. S-I had it retrofitted to serve their purposes. Whatever that may be. Then they assigned it to a new class. Just for the record. Even though the record was classified.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the bridge, there were only seven people. Five of them were wearing the standard Starfleet uniforms. The other two were decked out in civilian clothes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They were operatives. With the kind of work that they were involved with S-I made sure that they were not linked to Starfleet or even the Federation. They only wore their communicators while they were onboard Starfleet vessels.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">While off the ship each operative has a communication device implanted into the underside of his or her wrists. The devices are very hard to detect because they are made from Borg biomaterial and simply show up as muscle on bio-scans.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister looked around. In the captain's chair was the ship's captain, Captain Steve Giles. Giles was a Brit and he loved saying British things like 'bloody hell' and such.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other four uniformed people were the helmsman, the ops officer, the weapons officer, and a security officer guarding the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other plain-clothed man was sitting at a computer terminal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He was playing solitaire.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"CB?\" Chronister said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man spun around. It was Darien. Serena's old fianc&eacute;e. The man she was destined to be with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Darien grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"L &amp; A want to talk to you. They're on subspace.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shit,\" Darien replied. \"They're going to want to know what's going on with Lita.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister leaned on a console near Darien.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What are you going to tell them?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien shook his head. \"I don't know. I do know that we SHOULD NOT have allowed the Sisko crew on board.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien meant for his remark to be heard by the ship's captain.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Bloody hell! You can float around empty space all you like. I'd prefer to be able to move. No harm no foul.\" The captain replied, not turning.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You forget your place, Captain.\" Darien sneered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, I think you forget YOUR place,\" Giles said, still focused on the front of the bridge. \"Just because you are the boss's bitch boy doesn't mean you're in charge. So sod off wanker.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien begins to stand but Chronister stops him. \"Don't forget who every armed officer on this ship is loyal to.\" Chronister reminds him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien stands and pushes Chronister to the side. He starts to walk off the bridge to a room in the back of the bridge on the port side.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't even understand why we have to deal with these Starfleet pricks,\" Darien grumbles as he walks off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The captain turns and calls after him. \"You're going to tell them that you were recognized, right?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Screw you, WANKER!\" Darien yells back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles can only laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister walks down the bridge and sits next to Giles. \"Do I need to remind you that we are on the same side here?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles chucks his thumb in Darien's direction. \"I know whose side I'm on. Maybe you should have this chin-wag with him.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister sighs and turns toward the viewer.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She went berserk,\" Darien tells the male on the other end.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Berserk is NOT an explanation.\" He growled back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien bowed his head to collect his thoughts. He didn't care for being in trouble. He was always Section 31's best operative. Lately, though nothing seemed to be going right.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I was allowing her to become reacquainted with some of the bridge systems. She was looking at the long-range scans and noticed the Sisko. That's when she flipped out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She tackled a security guard and took his rifle. She shot me and the other bridge officers took off to engineering, got into the cloak control room, and shot the generator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The spike of neurons caused the explosion in the dilithium chamber knocking out the cloak and throwing us out of warp.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien sighed. \"A security team finally managed to stun her but not till after she set off the distress call.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why was the Sisko crew allowed to board?\" The male asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien shook his head. \"The CAPTAIN thought it would be a good idea to allow them to fix the chamber. Both of our engineers were killed in the explosion.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Were we compromised?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien shifted in his seat. \"I don't think so. But-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"BUT?\" The male was now obviously agitated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Raye saw me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Silence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How?\" A female finally asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I may have accidentally walked onto the bridge while Giles was talking with Saotome.\" Darien meekly replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There was some more silence while the two on the other end of the conversation talked amongst themselves.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, the male was the first to speak to Darien.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We're coming out there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien sat straight up. \"Art- Uh, A-Are you sure that's wise?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The male was very angry. \"I don't see we have much of a choice. This mission has been one bungle after another. All we asked you to do was to try and help Lita get over her experience.\" The male sighed and relaxed his tone. \"Then you go and get recognized by Raye. You KNOW she won't let this go.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien shook his head. \"Saotome won't pursue this.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You think?\" A replied. \"Do you think all of the engineers are as inept as Serena? Do you think none of them noticed the neurons in the chamber?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No.\" Darien sighed. He knew that A was right. This whole incident had generated questions. Even though Saotome was a very by the book captain, answering questions was in the book.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing good could come from this.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A agreed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"L and I will be boarding the Roseville within the hour. I want you to go back to the Sisko and monitor her status,\" A ordered. \"Try not to crash into them. Assuming you can do something right for 22 hours.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The connection closed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien stood up and kicked the chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing good.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien proceeded onto the bridge. Giles stood up and turned to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You look like you have orders.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Your grasp of the obvious is amazing,\" Darien replied. \"Intercept the Sisko. We're to monitor their status till A and L arrive aboard the Roseville.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles turned to his helmsman. \"You heard the dobber.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman nodded and the Minneapolis changed course and headed back to the Sisko.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles turned back to Darien when he noticed that he was leaving the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where are you going?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien turned to Giles. \"If it was any of your business I'd tell you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift doors shut.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles just turned to Chronister who shook his head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles sat back in his chair. \"Flid.\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita's door chime went off. She didn't feel like answering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita had spent the last six weeks recovering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A couple of those weeks were from her death. Luckily Section 31's medical staff was extremely good. She was also lucky that she was blown out of the pirate ship out of direct sunlight, where the temperature was a frosty 800 below zero. The cold flash froze her body, her blood, the air in her lungs. It basically put her in suspended animation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lucky. Ha.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sisko had transported her directly into stasis, which preserved her frozen state until she could be revived.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the physical recovery was over she still had to deal with the mental recovery.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The implant Section 31 had put in her brain to improve her memory had faulted. And faulted badly it did.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It burned out the neuro-pathways that lead to the part of her brain that controls anger and deals with ethics and her conscience. Without those parts of her brain to control her behavior she became violent and, for lack of a better term, evil.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The implant served its purpose though. She remembered everything.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that those pathways were restored her ethics kicked in and processed all that she had done over the last two years.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">And it hurt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She remembers shooting, stabbing, and killing people. She remembers torturing people till she got the information she needed. She remembered stealing and looting. She remembers pointless sex with pointless people.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What hurt her most is that she remembered trying to get information out of her best friend. The person who was nice to her when no one else with. The person who she fought side by side with for good. She remembers almost letting Brian kill her. She remembers what she almost did to Serena.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She also remembers what she did to Raye. She remembers standing there in the doorway to the cell and pulling the trigger.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She remembered Raye's body being slammed into the back of the cell by the blast.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She remembered Raye sliding to the floor in a heap.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She remembered making a joke about it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She remembered not caring if Raye died.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She remembered it all.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita began to cry again. She has been crying a lot in the past six weeks. She cried for the people she hurt. She cried for the people she killed. She cried for her friends who thought she was some evil monster.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The more she cried the more she wished it would end. She cried because she wished the Sisko had never recovered her. She knew that if she was just floating out in space &ndash; a dead lifeless body &ndash; she wouldn't have to remember.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the past three weeks, Section 31 had tried to get her back to work. She didn't want to. She just wanted to be left alone. If she was alone she could finish it. She wanted a phaser. Or a knife. Or anything sharp enough to cut through her wrists.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She'd tried it several times since she was put on board the Minneapolis. Every attempt failed. They put wristbands on her to keep her from slitting her wrists. They kept phasers away from her. She couldn't replicate aspirin or sleeping pills. She had no access to sickbay without an escort. She wasn't allowed within 10 meters of an airlock. She kept trying though - anything to end the pain. Anything that would end the memories that haunted her while she was awake, and the dreams that tormented her while she slept.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Originally, she thought that being with Darien would bring back good memories. It didn't.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien had changed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She wondered if the same thing that affected her was affecting Darien.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna had convinced her otherwise. Luna acknowledged that the implant was an experiment and that only she was implanted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She noticed how different Darien acted around others than he did around her. Darien seemed to care about her even after what she did to him. To him and Raye.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was obvious though that Darien was one of them. He was one of the ones who will preach 'at all costs' to the bitter death. He ate, drank, breathed, and slept Section 31.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita wasn't. She never was. She was in it because at first, it was something she was good at. She'd infiltrate a group whose only purpose was the destruction of the Federation. With her help Section 31 would eliminate them so quietly that no one ever knew they existed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Things were changing though. The Dominion war and the crew of Deep Space Nine brought Section 31 to the light. Those who move in shadows don't like light, so they were forced to change their tactics. Align themselves with groups who weren't the best role models for the model citizens the Federation was supposed to be.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After they implanted her she managed to complete a couple of missions. She started to grow tired of the routine though. Infiltrate. Uncover. Kill. Over and over and over &ndash; same shit, different day. Finally, she said the hell with it. After being picked up by a transport hired by Section 31 to bring her back to Earth she killed the captain and his crew. She took the transport and began to do things for herself. Eventually, she ran into the pirate captain. He made her a job offer and she accepted. They did something different every day. It was fun - fun until that fateful day six and a half weeks ago - the day she was killed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the implant was removed Lita realized that these people must be made to pay. For the assignations and the murders. For the governments that they overthrew. For the 'accidents' they arranged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita wasn't the one to do it though. She hurt too much. She could barely finish a meal before she'd remember something she did to someone while they were eating. She'd start shaking and break down in tears.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">No, she wasn't the one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The key would be to get off the ship and tell someone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But not just anyone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Realistically everyone knew of Section 31. Their creation is listed in the most available document in the Federation. But no one would go up against them. They knew what would happen. They would be considered a threat to the Federation. Section 31 would then eliminate them in the name of 'protecting the Federation at all costs'.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">No. Not just anyone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Between her crying and her suicide attempts, she came up with a plan.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She had to contact Serena.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena would believe her that it wasn't really her doing what she did.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wouldn't she?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She also thought that if needed she could contact Mina. She hadn't done anything to Mina. The group never really kept in contact once they split up. Mina wouldn't know what was going on.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She began to cry again when she found out that Mina served on the same ship with Serena and Raye. She knew then that her plan wouldn't work. Surely Raye and Serena had passed on what she did and Mina would hate her now too.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Amy. What about Amy?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In her research, she found out that Amy was in Starfleet as well. When she found out where she was she cried.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Amy had been posted to a ship on a deep space exploration mission. Mission duration: 20 years. 20 years in the wrong direction.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita couldn't wait 20 years. Every day Section 31 operated the way they did they went deeper and deeper underground. The deeper underground they got the more malevolent their tactics became.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">No. 20 years was unacceptable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When Darien took her to the bridge she played along. She'd be a good girl. She had to. She didn't have a plan. No matter what the guards were under orders to only stun her. No, she couldn't get them to kill her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She got to take a look at some of the consoles. The computers were new but the Federation interfaces were the same as they had been before. She could easily pull up the long-range sensor array.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing suspicious. Just looking around. Seeing what's out there.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just looking. No big deal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Till she found something.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not just any ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She had to get them over here. She couldn't hail them. They couldn't see her either. The Minneapolis was cloaked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They had to uncloak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She couldn't do it the easy way though. She didn't have the access codes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She could move freely throughout most of the ship though. Including engineering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If she could get to engineering she could take out the cloak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Too much security though. It won't be easy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guard on the bridge. He seems like he's half asleep. He'd be easy to take out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's decided then.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She knew this would be a win-win situation. If she disabled the cloak then the Sisko would come to investigate and the Minneapolis would be found out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She also knew that if she overloaded the core and caused a breach the ship would explode. Killing everyone. Including her. No more remembering. She'd be out one way or another.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She nodded to herself. She had to act fast before the Minneapolis got too far away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She slinked close to the guard and smiled at him. The guard who wasn't used to a pretty woman smiling at him, smiled back one of those goofy high school grins until he was clocked upside his head. He hit the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She grabbed his phaser. She shot everyone. She left the bridge and took the turbolift to engineering. Once there she shot everyone. She had to. The security alert had been sounded. Every security officer on the ship now had the sole purpose of stopping her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not killing her though.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She could complete her mission. She must complete her mission.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She entered the cloak control room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She took aim.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She fired.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The charge went through the cloak generator causing no damage.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Or so she thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She heard an explosion. She ran out into main engineering and looked into the warp core room. She saw the warp core offline and three bodies. The emergency bulkheads slammed into place. Red alert was sounded. She could feel the ship drop out of warp. She could hear the ship cloaking. She grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, she knew there was one other thing she had to do for her plan to&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">be a complete success.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She got to a communications panel.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Initiate distress call.\" She ordered the computer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It asked for a retina scan. She knew she didn't have access.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That guy did. The one she shot. He was second in charge of security. She drags him over to the computer and puts his head on the retina scanner. She held his eye open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Distress call initiated.\" The computer informed her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She smiled. Not a grin, but a real smile, for the first time in a long time. She succeeded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was then that she felt the familiar burning sensation. She was shot. She screamed. She fell to the ground. Several security officers put hand restraints on her and drug her back to her quarters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She didn't care.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Things would be better shortly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She even held onto her smile throughout the stunning. Throughout the officers piling on top of her. Throughout the dragging through the Minneapolis' corridors. Throughout being thrown into her quarters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She still smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She spent the ten hours after the Sisko's arrival staring at the ship through her window. It was the most beautiful ship she'd ever seen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She made a little sign and put it in her other window.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It read 'help me'.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She began to cry again when the Minneapolis turned away and warped off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She cried harder when she realized the ship had cloaked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The door chimed again. She continued to ignore it but was forced to turn around when she heard the doors open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Didn't you hear me chiming?\" Darien asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita just turned back to the window.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"L and A are on their way here,\" Darien informed her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"LUNA!\" Lita screamed. \"ARTEMIS!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You know we aren't &ndash;\" She wouldn't let him finish.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm not one of you anymore. FUCK your rules.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien sighed and sat at the foot of her bed. Lita scooted as far away&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">from him as she could while still staying in the window.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lita.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don't you mean LK?\" She smugly replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I want to help you.\" Darien said forcing what he thought would be a comforting smile.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita didn't even notice. She continued to stare out the window.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why did we change course?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien cleared his throat. \"I told you. We have to meet up with L and A.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"LUNA AND ARTEMIS! SAY IT GODDAMN IT!\" Lita turned and screamed at him, tears rolling down her eyes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien shook his head and closed his eyes. \"They care about you. They want to make sure that you are alright.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita turned back to the window. \"Is that why they made me into a monster? Do you know what I almost did to your 'fianc&eacute;e?'\" Lita scoffs. \"And what I DID do to your lover?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien turned away from her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We weren't just lovers.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita gently began to rock in her window. \"Yeah if you say so. Maybe if you'd been more interested in Serena than in Raye, like you were supposed to be, things would be different right now.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien sighed. \"I wouldn't have worked.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita turned back to him. \"IT'S FUCKING DESTINY! IT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED!\" She put her anger back in check and turned back to the window.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You're such an idiot, Darien.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien just stood and walked across the room. He sees the homemade distress sign in the window.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's this?\" He asked her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita shifted a little to make sure Darien only saw her back. \"Just the result of boredom.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien removed the note from the window. Lita had changed it. It read 'HELP ME &ndash; AIM HERE'.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's not funny. We &ndash; I don't want you to die.\" Darien noted as he crumpled up the paper and threw it into a trash disposal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She was over here, wasn't she?\" Lita said, changing the subject.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Did you watch her? Did you remember the good times?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien moved over to Lita's desk and looked some of her things over.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No. I was busy.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita whimpered out a laugh. \"Sounds about right.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien turned to her. \"I wasn't cheating on her.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I suppose you just tripped and fell into Raye.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien picked up a PADD that was on the desk and hurled it at Lita, missing her by only inches. The pad nails the window and shatters into a dozen pieces. Lita doesn't even move.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You don't understand anything, do you, Lita?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita continued her rocking. \"No. I suppose I don't.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I love Raye, not Serena. I married Raye, not Serena.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita just smiled to herself. \"And you ditched them both.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien, in obvious frustration, storms out of Lita's quarters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita just continued to rock while watching the stars whisk by.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "memories", "story": 3}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 14, "fields": {"chapter_number": 3, "title": "Deceptions", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma seemed to be fixated on the starfield in front of him. They hardly seemed to be moving. Of course, when you are at 1/2 impulse in relative terms, you hardly are moving. Especially when you are in open space and there was nothing else around you for light-years.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma leaned back and slid down in his chair a little bit more and sighed. The last 24 hours had been very uneventful. A plasma spike in impulse vent numbers seven and eight. A .009 percent deviation from norms in the artificial gravity field on deck eleven. A couple of light bulbs burned out in various different places.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The usual crap. No mysterious ships decloaking in front of them. No supposedly dead people walking around on the bridges of said ships. No one telling him 'that's classified.'</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nope. Nothing interesting. Pretty damned boring you'd think.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma's mind had been working, however. Working overtime. There were just too damned many questions that didn't have answers. Ranma couldn't stand that. He had to know what was going on all the time. If he had a question he wanted an answer regardless of whose toes he would have to step on.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They'd have to find their answers elsewhere though. The only lead they had was hundreds of light-years away by now.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma was snapped out of his trance by an abnormal chirping from Mousse's console.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mousse?\" Ranma asks, turning towards his weapons officer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse scratched his head. \"That's weird.\" He hit a few more buttons.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Any way you can be more specific than that?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Not really, no.\" Mousse replied, very matter of factly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo got up and walked over to his station. Mousse started to twitch around but managed to hold his cool. Ever since Shampoo's experience on the pirate ship she'd actually started to be nice to him. Not as nice as Mousse would have liked, but nice.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Proximity alert.\" Shampoo stated. She hit the same buttons Mousse did.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nothing on sensor though. Shampoo not understand.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to the ops station. \"Mina?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina was one step ahead of the order. She was checking out the logs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Something defiantly tripped the alert, but the sensor log shows nothing out there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Meteor?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shook her head. \"No, any debris large enough to set off the proximity alert would show up on sensors. I mean we are hit by hundreds of pieces of flotsam of whatever sort every hour. But none of them are big enough to even penetrate the deflection grid, much less set off a proximity alert.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So what was it?\" Shampoo queried.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mousse -\" Ranma ordered. \"Send out a tachyon burst.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse nodded and complied. A tachyon burst would detect any cloaked ships that weren't too far away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse' panel chirped and he shook his head. \"Nothing.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighed. Another mystery. He turned to his left. \"Raye do you sense-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma felt kind of stupid. No one was sitting there. He looked at the clock on the wall. 1120. He hit his comm badge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Saotome to Commander Hino.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Computer, where is Commander Hino?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer chirped. \"Commander Raye Hino is in her quarters, deck four section 11, quarters 411-023.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer was nothing if it wasn't specific. Ranma stood up and turned towards the lift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain?\" Mina asked. Ranma turned to her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"If you wouldn't mind, sir - let me go get her - after what she saw yesterday.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded and sat back down. Mina hopped up from her station and headed towards the aft turbolift.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander -\" Ranma called, continuing to look straight ahead. Mina turned to him. \"I'll let my desire to be nice and understanding make this decision once. However twice I will have to revert back to captain jerk mode.\" Ranma turned to Mina and gave her his best 'I'm serious' face.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded in understanding, walked into the lift. \"Deck four,\" she ordered. The doors closed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ranma?\" Ryouga asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma cleared his throat. \"ENSIGN Hibiki. On this ship, you are to address me as CAPTAIN or SIR. Understand?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga simply rolled his eyes. \"Captain?\" He said, not even trying to be subtle with the sarcastic tone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I think I may have made a wrong turn.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma eyed Ryouga. \"How do you figure?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga pointed to the viewscreen. A Cardassian scout ship was sitting in front of them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shit.\" Ranma screeched. \"All stop! Yellow alert!\" Ranma paused and realized that the ship wasn't there 10 seconds ago. \"Mousse? Where the hell did that thing come from?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Beats me!\" Mousse whimpered, placing the ship under yellow alert.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lights on the bridge of the Sisko didn't dim, but alert lights came on in the background. The humming of the Level 1 defensive shields came online. The sounds of the hull plating being polarized could be heard. Panels chirped to acknowledge that the photon torpedoes and phasers were coming online.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo checked out the display on her panel. \"We not in Cardassian space.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga grinned. Shampoo gave him her evil eye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We still 8 billion kilometers off course -\" Ryouga lost his smile. \"-but we still in Federation space, by a good trillion kilometers.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Tactical analysis,\" Ranma ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo checked out her panel while Mousse checked his. Shampoo was the first to answer. \"Phasers only, standard defensive shields. No threat.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse nodded. \"I concur. One quantum torpedo will nix the shields, and then a solid phaser blast will destroy it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"Hail them.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse complied and a Cardassian popped on the screen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Greetings! I am Gul Alek!\" The Cardassian stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma almost started to laugh. He'd never seen a Cardassian who was that friendly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm Captain Ranma Saotome of the Federation Starship, The U.S.S. Sisko.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nice to meet you, Captain.\" The Gul grinned. \"Not that I am complaining, but why are you in Cardassian space?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma cocked his head. \"I was about to ask you the same thing. Except that you are in Federation space.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Gul looked to another Cardie and shouted at him. He checked his computer and talked back to the Gul. This went on for a few seconds then the Gul turned back to Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm so sorry!\" He beamed. \"After doing a check it would seem our navigational computer is off by almost 20 light-years! We will get back to where we are supposed to be! Take care, Captain. Oh, and sorry if we startled you. We passed underneath you to get in front of you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No problem.\" Ranma grinned at the Gul. He returned the grin.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The screen went blank and the ship pulled a u-ie and warped off towards Cardassian space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mousse?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It was the ventral proximity alarm that got tripped.\" Mousse replied with some uncertainty in his voice.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked at Shampoo. \"What do you think?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Stink like wet cat.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shuddered. Wet he didn't like. Cats he really didn't like. This he hated.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lt;Nifty Star Trek Doorbell Sound Here&gt;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye rolled over in her bed. She looked at the door. Who the hell was bothering her? Her head was still pounding from the multiple vodkas she drank to help her get to sleep. It seemed to be the only way to get the picture of Darien walking across that ship's bridge out of her mind.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She didn't understand. He put her through hell faking his death. She was unable to do anything for months afterward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She wanted to kill him for putting her through that.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She knew she couldn't though. Her urge to grab and hold him outweighed the resentment for the pain he caused with his deception.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She wanted to hold him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Smell him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kiss him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She wanted it back the way they were before.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Part of her knew the relationship wasn't right though. Who was she to mess with destiny? Then again, if it wasn't supposed to happen, how did it?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She could remember the fun times they had. After he had broken up with Serena they had to keep it quiet. The other girls thought it was a horrible idea. She didn't like sneaking around, but she did what she had to do to be with the man she loved. The man who loved her, and always had.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eventually, Mina and Ami came around to understand that maybe Serena and Darien weren't meant to be. They also looked at the logic that if it was destiny then they would still be together. Serena and Darien.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, now it was Raye and Darien. That's what was happening and there was no point in fighting it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita didn't agree. Lita hated Raye for what she was doing to Serena. Because they were keeping it quiet, Serena thought that she was the reason that Darien dumped her. She thought it had to have been something that she did. She tried so hard to be the perfect girlfriend and get Darien back, but he just ignored her. This had damned near killed Serena. Damn near but it wasn't until Lita told Serena what really happened that she completely broke down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">All Serena knew in her life was flipped with those four words from Darien.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I love Raye, sorry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye wasn't sorry though. She knew that it hurt Serena, but she was tired of hurting herself. Loving someone who couldn't love her back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone knew what was going on except Serena. All she knew was that Darien dumped her. Lita brought the relationship to light.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The group was on a picnic together when Darien showed up. He said hello to Serena and started to chat with Raye. Lita watched Serena go through her own personal hell in her heart, trying to figure out why she dumped her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita couldn't hold it in anymore.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I love Raye, sorry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena asked Darien how he could do it. How he could just toss aside the woman who loved him more than anything. The woman he was meant to be with!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I love Raye, sorry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye loved to hear that. She loved to know that he loved her. She loved the feeling of knowing that she would be with him forever. She never concerned herself with the thought that maybe she would be on the receiving end of that sorry. No, she knew that Darien would never leave her. After all, he alienated his friends to be with her. He snubbed so-called destiny in the face for her. He'd never leave.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But he did.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not for another woman though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was 2148 when she got the call. She was at home, the home she shared with Darien, reading the Tokyo Times. She had some John Cougar Mellencamp playing in the background. That song Jack and Diane was her favorite.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He was at a London McDonald's eating some dinner. He was in London on business, but he would be home the next morning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">When she answered the transmission she saw a man in a London Police uniform. I'm sorry. The police officer said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those words echoed in Raye's head. All she could hear was 'I'm sorry.'</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The officer explained to her what had happened. He was eating a Big Mac when he just dropped over dead. The Big Mac was infected with the only case of Mad Cow disease in the past 300 years. He explained that Darien felt no pain and died instantly. He explained that after the autopsy that his body would be transported back to Tokyo for a funeral.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She didn't really hear that though. All she could hear was 'I'm sorry.'</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doorbell rang again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Go the hell away!\" Raye called out, rolling over.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Raye?\" Mina's voice carried through her door.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ugh - Mina, come in,\" Raye mumbled, putting her pillow over her head, hiding the tears that her memories had caused.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors slid open and Mina walked in. She looked at Raye's quarters. A mess. Not like Raye at all. Raye was more or less, a neat freak. It drove Mina crazy. Now, Raye's quarters looked a lot like Mina's quarters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina noticed several glasses all over the floor. She began to pick them up and put them into the replicator. She sighed when she saw the empty bottles next to the replicator. It's pretty bad when you go from glasses to the whole bottle.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I wanted to check on you,\" Mina said. \"It's 1130.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye sat right up. \"You're shitting me?!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shook her head while continuing to pick up the glasses. \"No ma'am. I talked the captain out of writing you up for it though.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye scrambled from her bed and into the shower. She was supposed to be on the bridge at 1100. She was lucky that she didn't have any counseling appointments. Not many people dared to ask Raye for advice. The ones who did were detained to make sure they didn't do anything to themselves. Raye had a way of making people feel worse than better.\"I've been thinking -\" Raye called from the shower. \"That ship was obviously a SI ship. You think that they made him fake his death in order to put him undercover somewhere?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded to the logic in that. \"I've heard that SI's undercover operatives do things like that. But I have never heard of them being on a marked vessel with Starfleet Officers on it. They don't want anyone to know who they are. In case of capture and stuff.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye walks out into the room in her underwear. \"Do you see a uniform in that anywhere?\" She points to a pile of clothes in the corner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sighs and begins to dig through the pile of garments. She pulls a uniform out of the pile and sniffs it. \"Yeah - but I'd replicate a new one.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye rolls her eyes and walks over to the replicator. She orders a uniform and it appears. She puts it on, places her pips on her collar, and puts on her communicator. She does one final check in the mirror and smiles. She nods to Mina and the two walk out the door.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pair walks down the corridor towards a turbolift. Raye turns to Mina as they walk. \"Did you come up with a plan yet?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Plan to do what?\" Mina dryly responded, knowing exactly what Raye was talking about.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Get Darien.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina stops, shakes her head, and grabs Raye's arm. \"Let's say we get him. What are we going to do with him? Do you REALLY think that he is being held against his will? Do you think that he WANTS to be gotten? Do you think that he went through all this trouble just so that we could find him six years later?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye shrugs. \"I need to see him. We need to get Darien. We have &ndash;\" Raye cleared her throat. \"I need to look him in the eye and say 'Darien &ndash; Why?'\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye and Mina continue and walk around the corner they were just a couple of feet from. They both screech to a halt when they see who was standing just around the corner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Darien?\" Serena whimpers, not looking at the two. She leans back against the wall. \"Get Darien?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sighed. \"Serena - Darien might not be dead.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena looked right at Mina and let out a gasp. She then hit the deck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Serena?\" The two girls called. Serena didn't respond. Mina hit her communicator. \"Sickbay - Medical emergency deck 4 section 16.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">An anonymous voice acknowledged the call and advised that he was dispatching EMTs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A minute or so later Akane and two techs came running around the corner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What happened?\" Akane asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She fainted,\" Mina replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The techs injected Serena with a hypospray. She let out a moan and opened her eyes. She looked up and saw a very handsome EMT kneeling above her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I should pass out more often!\" She giggled weakly. The tech grinned and helped her to her feet. She turned to Akane. \"Thank you, Commander.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane nodded, and she and the EMTs left. Serena looked at Mina, and then to Raye who was slinking towards the turbolift. Mina noticed this.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Serena, let's go up to the conference room and chat about this, okay?\" Mina asked. Serena nodded and the group went into the lift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift ride was one of the most silent and awkward ones Mina had ever been on. Even the one with the captain after she stabbed him in an attempt to out him as a founder wasn't this awkward. At least then she knew what to say to break the silence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena could really do nothing but stare in front of her. Darien. That was a name she hadn't heard in a while. Not one she was really too interested in hearing ever again. It had taken her a long, long time to get over Darien. It was eventually his death that got her to forgive him for what he did to her. It took her even longer to forgive Raye. She did though. They weren't friends like they were when they were all sailor scouts, but they were friends.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye simply watched her shoes. Even though she knew that it was better for Darien to be with her, she did feel guilty for hurting her friend. Raye did her best to hide it behind the emotional wall she built up after his so-called death, but she did have a conscience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eventually, the door opened and the three stepped onto the bridge. Ranma turned and smiled at the group.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander Hino. Nice to see you.\" Ranma snickered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye kept her head pointed to the floor. \"I'm so sorry, Captain.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"It's okay, this time.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nodded and shuffled off into the conference room. Serena followed her. Mina stayed behind to talk to the captain. She walked down the bridge and sat in Raye's seat, next to Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina leaned close to Ranma so that no one else on the bridge would be able to hear her. Shampoo adjusted herself slightly so that she would be closer to the pair, but she couldn't hear very well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain,\" Mina whispered. \"Serena knows who was on that ship now. I need to show her the video and explain what's going on.\" Mina half laughed at her own statement. \"Well, at least what we know about what's going on.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded but grabbed Mina's arm before she could get up. Shampoo watched the exchange with concern.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander -\" Ranma paused and let in a deep breath. He let out an even deeper exhale and continued. \"- Mina. I know that they are your friends but I need to make sure I know if they are going to compromise the security or safety of this ship-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina cut him off. \"They are my best friends. Have been for years.\" Mina sighed. \"I did take an oath to Starfleet. I know exactly what my priorities are. My loyalty is to you and this ship, sir. I will tell you if I know they are planning something.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma smiled and let go of Mina. She got up and walked into the conference room. Shampoo leaned in closer to Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ranma no trust blonde girl?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighed. \"Yes, I trust her. Just had to make sure.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo leaned back. \"If Ranma say so.\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We're out of their long-range sensor range, Captain.\" The helmsman told Captain Giles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Solid, cloak the ship and disable the sensor emitters.\" The Captain responded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman did as he was told. He nodded when it was complete.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Blimey then! Come about and intercept the Sisko.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister looked at the captain from his seat in the first officer's chair. \"Be careful not to get within 5000 meters again.\" Chronister ordered dryly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The captain nodded. \"Hear that Daniels?\" He barked at the helmsman.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Daniels nodded. \"I'm sorry. There is very little room outside of 5000 meters where I will still be in their plasma exhaust. It's only solid for 5500 meters and this ship is already 350 meters long!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The captain nodded. \"No need to quote me schematics. I know how long the ship is. But it's imperative that we don't get detected again.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aye, sir.\" Daniels replied, entering in the proper commands and swinging the Minneapolis around. \"Why exactly do I have to stay in their plasma trail? Isn't that a little bit dangerous anyway? One major static discharge and-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah.\" Chronister interrupted. \"But the plasma disrupts tachyon bursts. You'll be begging for a major static discharge if Chicago finds out that we were made.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good reason to be in it then,\" Daniels replied, returning his focus on his station, realizing that it would be better if he didn't do any more talking.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Did it work?\" Darien called from the back on the bridge as he came walking out of the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister stood and turned to him. \"More or less. We gave them a missing Cardassian scout ship, and an explanation for the proximity alarm. We're cloaked and on the way back.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien grunted. \"Let's see if this moron crew can do it right this time.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Just a goddamned minute,\" Giles said, standing and turning to Darien.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister grabbed Giles' sleeve and pulled him back into his seat. He then turned to Darien. \"ETA on L and A?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien looked at his watch. \"Fifteen hours, give or take. They said 22 hours, which meant they were probably about six hours away. A's got a thing about surprising people. They said they were in Chicago, but I doubt it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What do they plan on doing?\" Chronister asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien shrugged as he walked into the conference room. \"Shit I don't know. Probably blow the Sisko to bits.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Captain Giles watched Darien walk into the room and the door slide shut. He turned back to Chronister.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They wouldn't really kill those people would they?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister sat back down and turned his head slightly. \"They've destroyed entire planets over stolen documents before. I don't even think they would blink considering that an operative is involved.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The captain turned back to the screen. He knew that as a Starfleet Intelligence Officer that sometimes he was required to kill people. That really didn't bother him. They all got killed for a good reason. He, however, couldn't allow for the Sisko to be destroyed. They had done nothing wrong. As a matter of fact, if it hadn't been for him allowing them to come aboard they wouldn't even have known the Minneapolis existed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He came to a decision. If it came to it, he would defend the Sisko. The crew of the Minneapolis was loyal to him, not Section 31. The killing of 564 innocent Starfleet Officers was not going to happen as long as he had anything to do with it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister sensed something was on the captain's mind. He knew that by the way Giles and Darien were arguing that there was bound to be an explosion eventually. Three weeks of battling over who was in control can cause some major tension.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles stood and began to walk off. He turned to Chronister. \"I'll be in my ready room. Lt. Eckland, you have the bridge.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The female officer sitting at the OPS station nodded and had a seat in the captain's chair. She looked to Chronister. \"How ya doin'?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister laughed. \"Fine. How's the ferret?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eckland laughed back. \"She misses you. You need to visit more often.\" Eckland leaned over and gave Chronister a peck on the cheek.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'll have to do that.\" Chronister grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once Giles was in his ready room and the door had closed he hit his comm badge. \"Secure.\" The comm badge chirped twice. \"Giles to Commander Staff, can you please report to my ready room. Transport in please.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aye, sir.\" Staff responded.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moments later Staff materialized in front of Giles. \"Sir?\" Staff asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles stood and looked Staff right in the eye.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You and I have been friends for a very long time, right?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff didn't quite understand what his captain meant with the question. \"Sir? Of course we have. We still are.\" Staff paused for a moment. \"Aren't we?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles nodded. \"James - Something is going to happen. I believe that Section 31 is going to destroy the Sisko.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff's jaw dropped. \"Why?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You know how those damned cats are. The Sisko's crew knows something so they must be murdered.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff raised an eyebrow. \"You aren't going to let that happen, are you Steve?\" Staff stated more than asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles shook his head. \"No, I'm not.\" Giles cracked his knuckles and looked his friend right in the eyes, even more intently this time. \"I need to know that you are behind any decision I make.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff straightens his stance a little bit. \"As your friend, I am behind you on any decision you make, whether it be wrong or right. As your Chief of Security, I will follow you into the gates of hell if you ordered it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles cocked his head slightly and blankly looked at his friend. \"Do you think I am making the right decision?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff nodded. \"Morally, yes I do. As for fundamentally, well that will all depend on if we are alive in 24 hours.\" Staff let out a chuckle.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What about your staff?\" Giles queried.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Handpicked by me. They are loyal to me, and therefore to you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles grabbed his friend's hand and shook it. \"Thanks, James. And let's not mention this to anyone until we need to, okay?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff smiled and nodded. \"I'd be careful of the other officers though. Your operations people weren't picked by either of us.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff hit his comm badge. \"Transport Alpha 16.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff vanished in the usual pretty transporter effect. Giles sat back down in his chair, turned, and just stared out the window.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Remember that ship that you repaired yesterday?\" Mina asked Serena after sitting her at the end of the conference table.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This is the video of the conversation that the captain had with the captain of that ship before they departed.\" Mina punched some buttons and the video played. \"Computer, go to time index 1232.93\" Mina ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer complied and the video fast-forwarded. It stopped and began to play a few seconds before Darien walked into frame.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena stared intently at the video. Then she saw him. Darien. There was no doubt about it. She suddenly also came to the realization that the voice she heard on the communications system, the one that sounded familiar was his. Commander Chronister was talking to Darien.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell?\" Serena asked no one in particular. She looked to Raye who seemed to be on the verge of tears again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina cleared her throat. \"We've come to the conclusion that this ship works for Starfleet Intelligence. Or to be more precise Section 31.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye looked at Mina. Mina nodded. \"I did do some research last night, Raye. I talked to an old friend of mine who was an intern for the Federation Council. This is how Section 31 operates.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"To ensure that there is no 'wondering' about where someone who is an operative has gone; they 'kill' him or her.\" Mina had the computer punch up some other stuff. \"This is some declassified information that I got from my friend. Look familiar?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena nodded. \"That's the messed up warp core that they made us work on.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded. \"This is just Phase One of development from about three years ago. The other phases are still classified. Apparently, they placed orders for three of these.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So, there are three of those ships flying around here somewhere?\" Raye asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina again nodded. \"The same person who placed the order also asked for the retirement of three names from Starfleet Ship Services.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The Minneapolis.\" Serena noted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes.\" Mina agreed. \"Also the USS Roseville and the USS Ventura.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"ROSEVILLE?\" Raye exclaimed. \"That's the ship-\" Raye cut herself off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The ship that took Lita's body,\" Mina concluded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena could only shake her head in disbelief. \"Are &ndash;\" Her voice started to break but she really didn't want to start crying in front of Raye. \"Are you implying that Darien and Lita are Section 31 operatives?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina couldn't respond. She could only look at her friends.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the fuck was she doing on that pirate's ship?\" Raye finally asked after a few moments of silence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shrugged. \"There are really only two people who would know that and one of them is dead.\" She sighed. \"The other is on that ship, alive as you or I.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena stood up. \"Why didn't we go over there and talk to him when they came back?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina and Raye both looked at Serena like her head was screwed on backward.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What do you mean when they came back?\" Mina asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I was eating some cereal in 10-Forward before my shift. As I was getting ready to leave I looked out the window and saw that funky Defiant-looking thing sitting in front of us.\" Serena explains. \"I assumed that they were back for more help or something and I didn't wanna go back so I was on my way back to my quarters to hide when I ran into you guys.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina's brain kicked into overdrive. \"The Cardassian &ndash; Excuse me,\" Mina said as she tore off onto the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain\" Mina called as she ran around the bridge, shoved the replacement Ops officer out of the chair, slid into her seat, and began to run scans. \"That wasn't a Cardassian ship.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Shampoo exclaimed. \"Look like one to Shampoo!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I have to agree, Commander. The guy I was talking to looked like a Cardassian to me.\" Ranma stated</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"False sensor readings,\" Mina grunted as she continued to hit buttons. \"The view screen isn't a true view of what is outside. It's simply the sensors creating an image-based upon what they are seeing.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma started to get a headache. He didn't really know much about how things worked. As long as they did. \"So, how then do you know it wasn't a Cardassian ship?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I saw the real ship,\" Serena said from the back of the bridge. \"Out the window.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The ship can't actually become a Cardassian ship, so when you actually see it, it's a Starfleet vessel. That's what that proximity alarm was. When they went past us, they set off a proximity alarm because they got within five kilometers. Cloaked or not they take up space and they have mass.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The proximity sensors act more or less the same as old school radar. They send an energy pulse in every direction. If it gets returned to the ship, then it sets off the alarm.\" Mina finished with her button-pushing. \"We need actual cameras installed out the windows in different parts of the ship so that we can get a complete 360 X Y and Z axis view. I bet they are still out here&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">somewhere.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to Mousse. \"Do it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse acknowledged the order and took off. Ryouga turned to Mina. \"What good will the cameras do? So they had to uncloak to do their little Cardassian imitation. How do we see them if they are cloaked? I don't know much about cloaking technology but I know that when they are cloaked you cannot physically see them. They really are invisible.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shook her head. \"Right and wrong, Ensign. They aren't invisible. Light is reflected off the cloaking shields to give the physical illusion of being invisible. If you know what you are looking for, you can see them.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You know what you look for?\" Shampoo asked Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No ma'am,\" Mina replied solemnly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma thought for a second. \"I know who would.\"</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "deceptions", "story": 3}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 15, "fields": {"chapter_number": 4, "title": "Decisions", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis let out a light snort. It startled the helmsman of the U.S.S. Roseville. The bridge had been so quiet for the past two hours. A few of the standard Starfleet chirps here and there, but no real noise.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He turned to see Artemis sound asleep in the Captain's chair. He was curled up in one of those cute kitty-cat sleeping positions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman raised an eyebrow. He and a few of the other crew people had been wondering what would happen if they tried something.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That something is scratching the boss cats behind the ears. Most cats loved that, but would these cats?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman brought up his instant messenger console on his terminal and sent a message over to the ops station.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>'Watch my terminal for a second. I'm going to do it.'</em> The message read.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Ops officer looked at the helm station with his mouth gaped wide open. He began to type a reply.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>'Are you sure?'</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman nodded and began to type.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>'My cat at home loves it. Why won't he?'</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ops officer almost started to laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>'These aren't your normal cats. Good luck, see you at your execution.'</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman just scowled at his shipmate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He slid out of his seat and slinked to the command console. He sat down in the first officer's chair.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He began to scratch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis's ears twitched a little bit. The helmsman smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ensign,\" Artemis grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman lost his smile and stopped scratching. \"Yes sir?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I like that.\" The white cat replied. \"This is now your new job. Scratch behind my ears. Ops, get a new helmsman up here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aye.\" The ops officer chuckled. The helmsman just sighed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well hop to it, boy,\" Artemis ordered. \"Chop, chop.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman closed his eyes and began to scratch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moments later the turbo lift door opened and Luna walked out. She walked down the ramp and stood looking at Artemis and his ear scratcher.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What are you doing Ensign?\" Luna asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Um &ndash; Scratching him behind the ears.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna just shook her head. \"Take your post.\" She commanded. The ensign gladly obliged. Luna then hopped up into the XO's seat. She took a paw and started to poke her furry comrade.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Wake up.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis grumbled and turned to face Luna. \"What?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They were almost discovered. Again.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis sat right up. \"WHAT?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna shook her head. \"They are riding in their plasma exhaust to evade tachyon bursts. They got too close and set off a prox alarm.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They managed to convince the Sisko that they were just a wayward Cardassian scout ship though.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis was the one to shake his head this time. \"I'm going to send that ship and her entire crew to do recon in the Gamma quadrant. Keep them out of my fur for a good fifty years.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna chuckled. \"So what's the plan?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Simple,\" Artemis replied. \"Get Lita, blow up the Sisko, and go get sir fry. Shouldn't take more than twenty minutes tops.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna sighed. \"You really think we need to blow them up?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis rolls his eyes. \"What else are we going to do? They know of our classified technology. They know of our cloaking devices. They know that someone who is supposed to be dead is working for us. How else do you suppose we make them not know these things?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna frowned. She knew that there wasn't any other option. She was worried for Lita though. It had become obvious that Lita didn't want anything to do with Section 31 anymore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, Luna was worried. You can't just walk away from Section 31. Especially not on bad terms.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC had just gotten comfortable. He was in his underwear stretched out on his sofa with some soda and a pizza. He had 9 hours of Love Hina cued up on his computer. He was going to enjoy his day off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lt;Nifty Star Trek doorbell sound&gt;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mother fuck.\" JC grumbled. \"Who is it?\" He called out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain Saotome,\" Ranma called back from the other side of the door.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC scurried up off the couch and to his closet to grab some clothes. \"One second, Captain!\" He called.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After managing to put on some pants and a t-shirt he went to the door and opened it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain, good to see you.\" JC nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma smiled. \"May I?\" He said, motioning into JC's quarters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC nodded. \"Of course sir. It's a bit of a mess, though.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked into the room and had a seat at JC's dining table. He motioned for JC to sit and join him. Ranma took notice of the pizza box and six-pack of Mt. Dew on the floor next to the couch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I apologize for disturbing you,\" Ranma said while looking at the Mt. Dew. \"Do you mind if I steal one of those? I haven't had an Mt. Dew in months!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC started to stand. \"Sure! &ndash; Let me-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma waved his hand at JC. \"I'll get it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC sat back down as his captain grabbed two of the drinks and rejoined him at the table. He handed one to JC.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I need your help, Lieutenant,\" Ranma stated very matter-of-factly. \"We have a cloaked Section 31 ship following us. I need to find that ship.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC raised an eyebrow. \"Section 31? Well, a tachyon burst will let you know if there is a cloaked ship out there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head. \"We've tried that. Nothing comes up on the sensors.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC slid down in his seat slightly. \"Well, there is no cloaking technology that isn't susceptible to a tachyon burst.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Not even that experimental cloak that the ship you guys repaired had?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC shook his head. \"Tachyon energy cannot be absorbed. That would be the only way to-\" JC cut himself off, got up and ran to his dresser.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He pulled out a PADD and started to read it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Plasma exhaust disrupts tachyons.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Plasma exhaust?\" Ranma pondered. \"You mean they could be right up our ass?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well &ndash; in a manner of speaking, yes. The plasma exhaust goes down from the impulse and warp manifolds at a 45-degree angle.\" JC flailed his arms in a feeble attempt to visually explain what he was talking about.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Of course,\" Ranma said, finally realizing what that meant. \"The ventral prox alarm.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain?\" JC asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This cloaked ship set off our ventral proximity alarm earlier.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC nodded. \"They would have to be close. Plasma starts to dissipate at about 5500 meters. So they would have to be really close. I bet if we came to an emergency stop they would ram right into us. Granted that would more than likely destroy us, but you'd know they were there!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma laughed. He liked this kid.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you know how to visually detect a cloaked ship?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You mean like out the window?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, more or less. You have to pay real close attention though.\" JC stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stood. \"Sorry to do this to you, but I need you on the bridge.\" He looked at JC's couch. \"You can have tomorrow off, I promise. Report to Commander Aino in 20 minutes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC acknowledged the order as the captain left the room, slurping down his Mountain Dew, mumbling something along the lines of 'damn that's good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC had heard about Section 31. He really wasn't expecting there to be a tomorrow to have off.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Twenty minutes later.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC walked onto the bridge. He looked around. For the most part, it looked like business as usual. That was until he looked to the tactical station. There were Mousse, Mina, Ranma, Shampoo, and a couple of no-name tactical officers. There must be big doings afoot to have this many people pining over one station.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina looked up and over to the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ah! Lt. Devall! Glad you could make it!\" Mina smiled at him. JC walked over to where Mina was. She promptly leads him away from the tactical station and over to her ops station.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you think a plasma explosion would be enough to destabilize a cloak?\" Mina asked him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC thought about that for a minute. \"Depends on how big.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Big. Our plasma exhaust big.\" Shampoo called over to the pair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Maybe if you vented an extra 10 kilotons. That would do it. Just what's out there would make a pretty light show, and maybe scorch the paint on the bottom of the ship, but other than that, pointless.\" JC stated. \"But, unless you close our exhaust valves prior to igniting it, well, we will also become quite destabilized.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina pointed up to the viewscreen. \"This is a real visual out of the aft ventral observation room. The camera is pointed at about a 40-degree angle to our ventral - between the nacelles and down. I've been watching it, but I'm not really sure what I am looking for.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC stared at the screen for a moment. \"Stars.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina raised an eyebrow.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"When the ship passes in front of our view of a star it will reappear in a different position. It's part of the reflecting of the light.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC stared intently at the viewer for a good two minutes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"There.\" He called out. \"That star shifted downward about a degree or two.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you positive?\" Ranma asked, moving back into his chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes sir,\" JC called back. He stood up and allowed Mina to take her seat back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good. Shampoo begin.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo hit her communicator. \"Shampoo to Engineering. Serena vent 10 kiloton plasma now.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"VENTED!\" Serena's voice called out over the communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Close ducts!\" Shampoo ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"CLOSED!\" Serena hollered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mousse! Fire torpedo!\" Shampoo ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma spoke up. \"RED ALERT! ALL DECKS BRACE FOR IMPACT!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse hit some buttons. \"Torpedo away!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The torpedo streaked from the aft launcher, but only went about 500 meters then detonated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The explosion from the plasma was amazing. The Sisko was knocked for a loop. The shields glowed a fierce blue, as they absorbed a good deal of energy from the blast. The shock caused both nacelles to go from their healthy glowing blue to an offline black. The ship began to cartwheel away. Ryouga struggled to regain control of the ship while Mina worked on getting warp online, in case they had to make a break for it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC came crashing to the floor. Shampoo managed to hold her position standing next to Mousse. Ranma almost fell out of his seat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga regained yaw control of the ship. They were pointed away from the Minneapolis. Mousse punched up a different camera.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Outside the image of a ship could be seen phasing in and out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"TARGETED!\" Mousse screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"FIRE!\" Ranma ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A brilliant red stream of lights flowed from the Sisko's phaser banks, striking the Minneapolis. Since her shields were down she took some pretty heavy damage to her forward dorsal torpedo launchers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the Minneapolis' cloak was down completely, Ranma grinned.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga, bring us about. Mousse target their shields and weapons. Fire when ready.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both officers complied. Ryouga swung the ship around so that the two ships were facing each other. Mousse grinned as he entered the commands.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Phaser blasts from the Sisko hit the Minneapolis' phaser banks, scorching them. Three torpedoes then streaked from the Sisko hitting each of the Minneapolis' primary shield generators.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"All targets hit. The blast caused minor damage to our shields.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina spoke up. \"The safety system kicked in and knocked warp offline, but it's coming back now.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma acknowledged her as Mousse spoke up again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We're being hailed.\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bridge crew of the Minneapolis went flying in every which direction. Captain Giles included.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?\" Giles screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ops officer climbed back into her seat. \"They discharged 10 kilotons of plasma then ignited it &ndash;\" She cut herself off. \"THEY'RE FIRING!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ship shook hard again. Crew people went flying once again. Panels exploded and steam ducts ruptured.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SHIELDS!\" Giles screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ops officer climbed back into her seat once again. \"EPS RUPTURE! I HAVE TO BYPASS TO GET THE SHIELDS BACK ONLINE!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman's eyes became all white. \"They &ndash; they're coming about.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ballocks,\" Giles said as he realized he was face to face with the most heavily armed ship in the Federation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The turbolift opened and Darien and Chronister came onto the bridge. Darien was the first to speak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister, mouth wide open, just pointed to the viewer as the phaser blasts from the Sisko approached the Minneapolis.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once again people and machinery were thrown askew. Darien was slammed against a wall, smacking his head. He hits the deck and doesn't move. Chronister slaps his communicator and calls for medical assistance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The torpedoes looked to be the last thing that the Minneapolis captain would ever see. They slammed into the ship with a tremendous explosion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles was somewhat relieved when he realized that he wasn't dead yet. He looked to his ops officer. \"Shields?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She simply shook her head. \"They took out the primary shield generators. The secondary won't be working till we get the EPS grid repaired. The cloak overloaded them with the first shot.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Can we cloak?\" Chronister yelled. Darien was beginning to come to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No.\" She called back. \"The cloak is fried.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"To hell with the cloak, return fire!\" Darien called, stumbling to his feet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"NO!\" Giles yelled. \"DO NOT FIRE ON THAT SHIP.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ops officer looked at her captain, then back to Darien. \"Sir &ndash; they did fire on us first.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles glared at his Ops officer. It was at this time that two security officers entered the bridge from the forward turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am your captain, not him. You bloody fire on that ship and you will be spending what remaining time we have left in the brig.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien stood and starts to walk, but stumbles slightly. \"RETURN FIRE!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ops officer sighs and starts to hit some buttons. She almost looks disappointed when nothing happens.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I locked out her station.\" The helmsman states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles pats him on the shoulder. \"Crewman, take her to the brig.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien now begins to run down the bridge. \"FIRE ON THAT SHIP!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien charges right for the captain. He's stopped by a phaser blast to the back. Giles looks to the back of the bridge where he sees Staff.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Take him to his quarters and lock him in.\" Staff tells one of the security officers. He complies while the other takes the ops officer off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff now has his weapon pointed at Chronister. \"So. What's it to be?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister motions for him to put his weapon down. \"I have no interest in seeing the Sisko destroyed.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff lowers his weapon as four more security officers arrive on the bridge. \"Keep an eye on him. Let him move around, just watch him.\" Staff orders. The security officers acknowledge the order.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff walks down and takes a seat at the ops station. \"Order?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles sits back down in his chair. \"Hail them.\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"On screen.\" Ranma orders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Captain Giles appears on the screen. Behind him, he can see that the bridge is a mess of parts of the wall and other miscellaneous parts the fall off during an attack.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nice to see you, Captain Saotome.\" Giles smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to Raye who turned to Mina who turned to Ryouga who turned to Shampoo who turned to Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse simply shrugged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, likewise,\" Ranma grumbled. \"What's the deal?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm going to be blunt with you,\" Giles stated. \"We're a Starfleet Intelligence ship employed by Section 31. We're on a mission, which you actually didn't have any part in. Until the mishap in engineering that is.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Right, right,\" Ranma noted. \"Your so-called overload from the so-called nebula because of the nonexistent scout ship?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles laughed. \"I am not usually the liar. I just fly people around. I'm not very good at it, am I?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head. \"No sir.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye stood up and walked toward the viewscreen. \"May I?\" She asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where's Darien?\" Raye asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles raised an eyebrow. \"And who might you be, young lady?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Raye. Lt. Commander Raye Hino.\" She meekly replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ace! I've heard of you. CB had quite the thing for you. I can see why, too. You are very pretty. I certainly wouldn't have picked career over a bird-like you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A tear came to Raye's eye. \"Where is he?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He's currently being held in his quarters. He attempted a cute little mutiny just a moment ago. As a matter of fact, if it hadn't been for my security team you folks wouldn't even exist anymore.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We targeted and destroyed your weapons!\" Mousse cried out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles shook his head. \"Our conventional weapons. We have more. You did though do a good job of taking out our shields. Bravo! Once your tour of duty is up on the Sisko, Lieutenant, I may have to recruit you for myself!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So why are we still here?\" Ranma asked, somewhat dryly and upset that all of this is being taken so lightly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles pointed to his communicator. \"You see this, Captain? You have one also. It states that we are Starfleet Officers. I'm not against you, Captain. You were justified in your attack. You didn't know that this was a Starfleet ship cloaked and sitting in your plasma exhaust.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Unfortunately I am responsible for the situation you are in right now.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Situation? You mean you and me?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, sir, I am afraid that the trouble you are in is much worse. Currently, there is another Section 31 ship warping this way right now. Onboard is the head of Section 31. They plan on getting something off of this ship, destroying it and my crew, your ship, crew, and probably anything else within 10 light-years.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am going to help defend you against this ship.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We do a good job against you!\" Shampoo said. \"Why think we need help?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You won't catch them by surprise. They won't make an attempt to hide when they get here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So what can we do to defend ourselves?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You need to use a rotating shield frequency. Their weapons are Borg in origin.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looks to JC who is standing off in the corner. \"Go to engineering and let Serena know.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">JC just nods as he runs off the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"When will they be here?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles just shrugs. \"Beats me. I think they are coming from Earth. If that's the case we have just over three hours. But the cats never tell us where they are coming from nor when they will be here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Cats?\" Both Mina and Raye asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah. Can you believe it? The head of the most terrifying force in the Federation is a couple of cats.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye and Mina could only stare at each other.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We will hail you again once our shields are repaired, Captain Saotome,\" Giles noted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"Sisko out.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just prior to the transmission ended a person walked across the back of the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"THAT GIRL!\" Shampoo screamed.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "decisions", "story": 3}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 16, "fields": {"chapter_number": 5, "title": "Actions", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You guys realize that you're dead men walking if you lock me in here,\" Darien grumbled at the security officers poking him in the back with their phaser rifles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lead one just shrugged. \"I've known that from the first day I worked for Section 31.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I can protect you if you let me go!\" Darien replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second guard spoke up this time. \"No, you can't. You will be just as dead as us. We know what's going on. The cats are going to get the girl. Then they are going to destroy the Sisko and then destroy us. Done and done.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien just grumbled as he is shoved through his doorway and into his quarters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The security guards close the door behind him and a chirp is heard to signify that it is locked and sealed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien walks over to his desk. He opens up a drawer and pulls out a phaser. He places it in his belt line. He then walks over to his closet and grabs a phaser rifle. He straps that to his back. He starts to walk over to the bathroom but pauses and looks back into his closet. He proceeds back to the closet and grabs a small box. He opens it and inside are six long stem roses.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Might need to go old school on these assholes.\" Darien grins to himself. He puts on a leather coat and places the roses in his inside pocket.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien then walks over to his bed and pulls a backpack out of it. He puts the backpack on and walks to the bathroom.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the bathroom, he pulls a panel off the wall. Behind the panel is a crawlspace just barely big enough for him. He gets into it and crawls away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Idiots.\" He murmurs.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT DID YOU SAY?\" Ranma exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo see girl from pirate ship!\" Shampoo blubbered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked to Mina who was bringing up the replay. Sure enough, walking across the bridge towards Chronister's position was Lita.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She looks really good for a dead woman.\" Ranma mused.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How?\" Raye just grumbled. \"Why is she everywhere there is trouble?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She must have been a Section 31 operative,\" Ryouga concluded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, we knew that two chapters ago,\" Mina mumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hail them!\" Ranma ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse complied but cocked his head when he got the response. \"Uh &ndash; Ranma &ndash; I &ndash; I think I got an answering machine.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT?\" Was the response from the entire bridge crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse punched it up on the viewer. A picture of a very pretty female officer appeared.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm sorry! We are unable to answer your hail right now, but if you would leave your name, number, and a message after the tone we will be sure to get back to you as soon as possible!\" The female smiled and a tone is heard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh &ndash;\" Ranma started. \"This is Ranma Saotome, USS Benjamin Sisko, NCC 255108, just calling because we saw someone that we thought was dead on your bridge. The girl &ndash;\" Ranma looked to Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lita,\" Mina replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lita,\" Ranma stated to the recording. \"She's a friend of some of my crew and they would like to speak to her.\" Ranma paused and shuddered. \"That is unless she's a zombie.\" A tone is heard and Ranma dropped his head. \"That was moronic. A zombie?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah.\" The entire bridge crew agreed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Enough of this. Get ready for battle.\" Ranma ordered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The entire bridge crew acknowledges the order and scurries off to their stations to get ready to fight.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"THEY WHAT?\" Artemis yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bridge officer that reported the bad news to the white cat cowered in fear. Artemis pounced on him and began to swipe at him with his claws. Luna just shook her head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"ETA?\" Luna asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"45 minutes.\" The ops officer replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Will they have their shields repaired by then?\" Artemis asked, never looking up from his maiming.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes sir,\" Ops replied, adjusting slightly so that he could make a quick getaway if necessary.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis hopped off his prey and back into his seat next to Luna. \"Wonderful. Just fuckin' wonderful.\" He looked to Luna. \"It appears that our people, the best operatives in the Federation, have just been beaten by the most rag-tag group of losers in Starfleet.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What about Mina, Raye, and Serena?\" Luna asked, defensively.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mina was the only qualified officer placed on that ship. I want to retrieve her if possible.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna glared at Artemis. \"And just blow up Raye and Serena?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You know I don't like this any more than you. I have no interest in killing the girls or any of the other 600 people on that ship but we have a job to do.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna continued her glare. \"No compromises?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What did you have in mind?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna cleared her throat. She had been thinking about this for quite some time. She was having problems sleeping after she began to think about the girls. They didn't deserve to be killed over stupid mistakes. She at first blamed Giles for allowing the crew of the Sisko to board, but then realized that she was the one to blame. If she hadn't implanted Lita none of this would have taken place. She knew that she could not allow the Sisko and her crew to be killed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I think the fear of a return visit would be enough to ensure their silence. Not everyone on that ship knows what's going on. Maybe 50 or so officers. We just retrieve our people off the Minneapolis, destroy it, and let the Sisko know that if they breathe a word of this they will have to be terminated.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis rested his head on his paws. He was glad that he had Luna with him. She was a good conscious. He did tend to get caught up in procedure and policy at times. Luna made a good voice of reason. She helped him realize that these are people they were dealing with.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We'll see how it goes when we get there,\" Artemis replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna smiled. She knew she wore the pants in this relationship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ops spoke up. \"We're being hailed by CB on his secure personal transmitter.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"On screen,\" Luna ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A picture of Darien appeared. He appeared to be scrunched up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you in a crawlspace?\" Artemis asked, standing up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah,\" Darien replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why?\" Luna asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"As I am sure you can see the Minneapolis has been compromised. What you can't see is the fact that Captain Giles refused to return fire on the Sisko when we were attacked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I ordered the return fire and he disobeyed. I attempted to take control of the ship and his security team shot me and locked me in my quarters. I am currently crawling through an escape tunnel that we installed for this very reason. I should be coming out on deck two somewhere.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where are Lita and JC?\" Artemis asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't know. JC was on the bridge with me, but he more or less surrendered. LK was confined to her quarters after shooting the cloak.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Great,\" Artemis grumbled. This complicates things quite a bit. \"Is there anyone on that ship that you are sure will be loyal to us?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien thought for a second. \"The ops officer, Lt. Eckland, was arrested for attempting to comply with my return fire order. She might help, but she is being held in the brig which is on deck five.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I know what deck the brig is on.\" Artemis shot at Darien. \"Get her. If she can help you regain control of that ship then use her.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"A &ndash;\" Darien whined. \"It will be like 50 against two.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Of for God's sake, Darien,\" Luna screamed. \"When you were Tuxedo Mask you went up against people that were armed with much worse items than phaser rifles and you lived. Work your way down. Get the ops officer out of the brig then go to engineering and take control of the ship from there. There won't be any engineer's right?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No,\" Darien replied. \"They were all killed in the explosion.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good. Remember, you are only to regain control of the ship. Do not fire on the Sisko and do not kill anyone you don't have to. Report back when you have some more information.\" Luna ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"FIND LITA TOO!\" Artemis yelled before the communication was terminated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis looked to Luna. \"Do you think that they will fall into line like you think the Sisko crew will?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna just sighed and put her head on her paws. \"They have to.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And if they don't?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna sighed. \"Then may God have mercy on their souls.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis just eyed Luna for a few moments. He then placed a paw on Luna's back. \"You are a good person, Luna.\" He reached his head over and kissed Luna on the top of her head. He then strolled off and into a turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Funny,\" Luna said to no one. \"I sure as hell don't feel like a good person.\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"YOU WHAT?\" Giles yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita backed up slightly. Giles had a very loud voice but his ready room acoustics seemed to make it even louder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm sorry,\" Giles said when he realized he startled her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's okay,\" Lita replied. \"As I said when I was on the bird of prey I had no ethics controlling my actions.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Because of the bloody implant?\" Giles asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah.\" Lita nodded. \"The Sisko's first officer. I kind of tortured her.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So you want me to turn you over to them for punishment?\" Giles wasn't quite sure why Lita would ask him to do such a thing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They are going to be destroyed. I need to make amends before that. I feel that a suitable punishment for me would to be killed along with them. Alongside my friends.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The ops officer, the councilor, and the chief engineer, right?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lita, I really haven't gotten a chance to know you these past few weeks. It's been on purpose. I don't much care for Section 31 operatives. I more or less picture all you guys like Darien.\" Giles can only grimace at the thought of 50 Darien's running around the quadrant.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"My first reaction is to tell you to piss off and lock you back in your quarters.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita frowned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"However, you do not seem one bit like the other Section 31 cronies. I will honor your request. I don't know if it's the greatest of ideas though. I'd avoid the first officer if I were you though.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita smiled. \"Thank you, Captain.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita began to tear up as Giles came around his desk. Lita gave him a big hug. The pair then walked out onto the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"STATUS!\" Giles yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ops was the first to reply. \"Shields back up to 67%. The Sisko totally fried our phasers and the dorsal torpedo bays. All we have is the ventral stern and aft torpedo launchers and the EM cannon.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ugh.\" Giles groaned. \"Get the shields as high as they can go.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aye, sir,\" Ops replied. \"But we are running on our secondary generators. If they go out, we're dead.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles looked at his bridge crew. \"Our point today is not to survive. It's to make sure that they survive.\" He points to the image of the Sisko on the viewscreen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lita will be leaving us shortly,\" Giles stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister looked up from the panel that he was working on. \"Steve &ndash;\" he began. Giles shook his head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I know that the only thing they will be taking alive is Lita. I am hoping that if she is aboard the Sisko they won't destroy her. Besides, this is Lita's request. She wants to make amends to her friends and the people that she hurt.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita walks over to Chronister and gives him a hug. \"Thanks for everything. You've been really good to me and actually tried to help me deal with all of this.\" Lita flailed her arms. \"If I am forced to continue this life, I need to make sure that I know that my friends don't hate me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hail the Sisko,\" Giles ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma's image popped up on the screen. Ranma was the first to speak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How did you guys get an answering machine?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles just laughed. \"It's simply to confuse people.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I see.\" Ranma grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo comes running into the shot, promptly knocking Ranma to the deck. \"I SEE DEAD PEOPLE! YOU DEAD! I SEE YOU BLOWN INTO SPACE! YES I DID!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita took a deep breath and stepped forward. \"I was flash-frozen when I was blown out the breech. Your medical team got me into stasis fast enough that the medical staff on Earth was able to revive me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo's eyes were full of tears. \"Shampoo fix that!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita took in another deep breath. \"This is why we are hailing you, Captain. I would like to remand myself into your custody.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma crawled back to his feet and cocked his head. \"My custody?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nodded. \"I hurt your crew, and I need punishment. I want to transport myself to your ship, where you may find a suitable punishment for me. All I ask is that first I get some time alone with Raye, Serena, and Mina to try and explain my actions.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT ABOUT SHAMPOO?\" Shampoo screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander. I cannot expect you to forgive me. This is why under Starfleet Uniform Military Code of Justice, Section 401 paragraph 11, I am waving my right to trial for torture and attempted murder, and request that you sentence me under the same guidelines.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That's death,\" Ranma stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina popped into the shot, knocking both Shampoo and Ranma to the floor. \"Lita &ndash; what are you doing?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'll explain everything when I get there, if that is okay with you, Captain.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stood once again and nodded. \"Mousse, send a security team to transporter room two. Raye, Mina, get Serena and meet them there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned back to the screen after helping Shampoo back up. \"I have someone else on board who wants to talk to you too.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita raised an eyebrow. \"Who?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Gosnell.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita gasped. \"Gosnell?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There was a few moments of silence as Lita just stood, stunned. Giles decided he needed to break the silence. \"Captain, we will be ready to transport shortly. Transport off the ship is impossible except in certain locations. Soon as we get to one of them we will contact you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"Sisko out.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles turned to Lita. \"Ready?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She smiled and nodded as the two started to walk to the turbo lift. Chronister spoke up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Steve. I will take her. You are needed on the bridge.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles looked to Lita who nodded again. \"Okay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chronister and Lita stepped into the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff turned to Giles from where he was watching from the back of the bridge. \"Are you sure that was a good idea?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No. But even in the dark ages, they honored last requests.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ops spoke up again. \"LK has been transported.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good. Shield status?\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"88%.\" Ops' panel started to chirp. \"What the-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT?\" Giles asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"All system functions have been rerouted to engineering!\" Ops replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Darien,\" Giles swore. \"James.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff didn't have to be told twice. He hit his communicator. \"Security teams one through four to engineering immediately. CB has seized control of the ship. Stop him with any means necessary.\" James began to walk to the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As he walked away Giles could hear what was being said to Staff on his communicator. \"Sir &ndash; Lt.

We have three officers down.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff acknowledged the message.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Be careful,\" Giles ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Staff nodded and entered the lift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Try and regain control.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ops nodded and then gasped. \"Shit. Federation ship uncloaking 2-3-1 mark 2-0.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Crikey,\" Giles replied.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Federation ship decloaking off their port aft!\" Mousse yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Is she on board?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SHIELDS!\" Ranma called. Mousse complied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sir!\" The ops replacement called. \"The Minneapolis is locking her weapons on us!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell?\" Ranma grumbled. \"Hail both ships!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien appeared on the viewscreen. \"Greetings, Captain!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Who are you? Where is Captain Giles?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien laughed. \"He's on the bridge however I am in control of this ship now. Prepare to die!\" The screen went back to the forward view from the Sisko.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Minneapolis began to move forward and upward. Suddenly several torpedoes are fired from the bottom of the ship. Each torpedo hit the forward shields of the Sisko, rocking it hard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shields are holding!\" Mousse screamed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stood and sighed. \"Return fire-\" He is interrupted by Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"LOOK!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second ship began to fire on the Minneapolis.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell?\" Ranma asked. \"Hold your fire!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo simply shrugged as Mousse complied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Target the second ships phaser array,\" Ranma ordered. \"Fire when ready.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse complied and fired. \"No damage and they are targeting us now.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma groaned. A fierce blue beamed slammed into the Sisko. It didn't however shake the ship. Mousse started to flip out though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SHIELDS DOWN! ALL WEAPONS OFFLINE!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ops continued the list. \"IMPULSE OFFLINE! WARP OFFLINE!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell was that?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ship fired the same weapon at the Minneapolis.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's some sort of electromagnetic weapon!\" Mousse stated. \"The Minneapolis has been rendered in the same shape we are in.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly several figures began to transport onto the bridge. All in all 18&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Starfleet Security personnel appeared, their weapons trained on the bridge crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No one move.\" The head security officer ordered. \"Anyone tries anything and this ship will be destroyed.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded to his bridge crew for them to comply with the order.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of the security officers moved the Sisko crew away from their stations and had them sit in the middle of the bridge. They had Ranma and Shampoo sit in their chairs. They then went and locked out the bridge stations that they allowed their operators to stay at.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Glad that other ship was here to help,\" Ryouga grumbled to himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm Captain Ranma Saotome. Who are you people?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The head security guard lowered his weapon and went over to speak to Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We're with Starfleet Intelligence. If you cooperate your ship, and your crew will not be harmed. Where is the rest of your senior staff?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shrugged. \"They're somewhere on the ship. I think deck two one or three.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This is deck one.\" The guard replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was at this time Mina came running out of the turbolift only to be greeted by three phaser rifles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"See!\" Ranma stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh-\" Mina stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Who are you?\" The lead guard asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander Mina Aino. Chief Operations Officer. What's going on?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ah third in command. Wonderful. Have a seat.' The guard motioned for her to sit in the seat on Ranma's left.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina complied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain?\" She asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma pointed to the second ship on the screen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Our supervisors will be hailing you shortly.\" The lead guard stated.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Earlier.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina, Raye, Serena, and three security guards were waiting in transporter room two.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They're ready.\" The transporter chief stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Energize,\" Mina ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The usual pretty transporter effect started and when it was complete Lita was standing there.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lita,\" Mina said as she walked up the pad and gave her a hug. She looked to the security guards. \"Please wait outside.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guards nodded and walked out. Mina looked to the transporter chief. \"You too.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He nodded and left.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sat down and had Lita sit down next to her. Serena and Raye also sat down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye was the first to speak. She spoke with a lot of anger in her voice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You wanted to explain? You wanted to apologize. Have at it. I'm nothing but fucking ears.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita was trying her damnedest to keep from crying. She took a deep breath and explained to her friends about her joining Section 31. She explained to them about the missions she went on. She explained to them about Luna and Artemis being in charge. She explained to them about the memory implant. She explained how the implant affected her. She explained how she ended up on the pirate ship. She explained the last few weeks aboard the Minneapolis and what Darien's role in Section 31 was. She explained it all.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"-and-\" Lita could no longer hold back the tears. \"And I am sorry for what I did to you, Raye. And what I did to you, Serena.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye cocked her head. \"You shot me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita took a couple of breaths. \"You know I have had a lot of hostility towards you ever since-\" She cut herself off and looked to Serena who was looking to the floor and twisting her hair between her fingers, obviously trying her hardest not to cry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"-Ever since you and Darien got together. I couldn't control my hostilities anymore. They all just came out with that one shot. You know how you get angry at someone and you just want to hit them? But your conscience tells you not to. Well, I didn't have my conscience. There was nothing telling me not to shoot you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye found herself for the first time feeling guilty about her relationship with Darien. She was beginning to understand exactly how many people she had affected. She didn't realize she hurt Lita also.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I-\" Serena stammered. \"I love you, Lita. I forgive you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita began to cry again as she embraced Serena.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I also forgive you, Lita,\" Raye said. She looked at her feet and cleared her throat. \"Will you forgive me?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita looked to Serena who nodded to show that she already had. Lita then turned Raye. \"I will &ndash; I do. I forgive you, Raye.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly the ship rocked violently. Mina stood. \"I have to get to the bridge.\" She kissed Lita on the cheek and bolted from the room. As she left, Gosnell walked in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"OH MY FUCKING GOD!\" Gosnell exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita stood and the pair simply stared at each other for what seemed like hours. It was only a couple of minutes though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, Gosnell broke the stare as he ran over and grabbed Lita. He hugged her tight and kissed her passionately. Lita was more than happy to return the affection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena and Raye could only stare wide-eyed as the two continued their show of affection. Neither of them knew that Lita had known Gosnell. Lita was the love of the man who always hit them with water.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell and Lita eventually broke the embrace and Gosnell began to blubber like a little baby.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What? How! Why? Who! Where? When!\" He stammered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita laughed. \"We can talk about it, but I have to go with some people. You can come too.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell nodded. The four walked out the door and into the corridor. Lita nodded to Serena and Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'll come and visit you after work,\" Serena noted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nodded and after hugging Serena, they walked off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita put her hands behind her back and stood in front of one of the security guards. Gosnell started to stammer again when he saw the guard putting hand restraints on her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell are you doing?\" He asked, stepping forward. The other two guards moved in front of him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's okay, Gozz,\" Lita stated. \"Can he come with? I need to talk to him.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lead guard nodded. And the group of four headed off towards the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's going on?\" Gosnell asked Lita.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I did some terrible things on the pirate ship. I need to be held accountable for them. I've turned myself over to the Captain.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell didn't like this. Not one bit.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So, I haven't seen you for three years and now that I do get to see you you're going to jail? This is worse than a god-damned Jerry Springer episode!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita sighed. \"Not for long though.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What do you mean 'not for long'?\" Gosnell asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"My crimes are punishable by death.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell stopped.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No way,\" Gosnell stated. He resumed and caught back up. \"No fucking way. I won't let them kill you. The captain and I-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Gozz-\" Lita interrupted. \"Section 31 is more than likely going to blow this ship to bits. All of us included.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell looked to the floor and continued to walk in silence.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye and Serena got into the turbolift.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Bridge,\" Raye stated. The computer chirped back a reply.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Access to the bridge is currently denied under security procedure 213.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Raye asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's security procedure 213?\" Serena asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How the hell did you become a Lt. Commander?\" Raye grumbled. \"It means that the bridge has been overtaken by hostile forces.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So what do we do?\" Serena asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We need to go to engineering and attempt to regain control of the ship,\" Raye told Serena. \"Engineering!\" She told the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lift complied and the pair was jetted down to the engineering deck. Raye hit her communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander Hino to the brig.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ensign Stark here, Commander.\" A female ensign replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Find as many security officers and quietly as possible and have them report to engineering. Procedure 213.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am.\" She replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena just looked at Raye. She was ready to be a captain. Raye was in the zone. She really had begun to admire her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Stop staring at me!\" Raye barked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena just started to cry.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bridge of the Minneapolis had nine of the Roseville's security team on it. Unlike the Sisko though, these officers had restrained the crew with hand restraints. Plus all of the officers were placed on the floor face down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shortly thereafter Darien and Lt. Eckland walked onto the bridge. The guards all trained their weapons on her. Darien waved his hands.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She's cool.\" He stated. The guards then lowered their weapons. Darien walked over to where they had Captain Giles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where is LK?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hell if I know,\" Giles replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien chuckled and then kicked Giles in his side. \"Where is she?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Giles gritted his teeth. \"She's aboard the Sisko.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien lost his smile. \"What?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She wanted to depart, so I transported her to the Sisko. She said she wanted to die with her friends.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The turbolift doors opened. Luna and Artemis walked out and onto the bridge. Artemis was the first to speak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where's Lita?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien shifted a bit. Artemis had the ability to make even the most fearless of people scared. \"Giles sent her over to the Sisko.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis rolled his eyes. Luna smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hail them.\" She ordered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a few seconds, the bridge of the Sisko appeared. Shampoo, Ranma, and Mina were shown, along with a couple of the security team securing them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes?\" Ranma dryly asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good day, Captain. My name is Luna &ndash;\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna noticed the captain fidgeting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Something wrong?\" Luna asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No.\" Ranma squeaked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good. As I was saying my name is Luna. I and Artemis here are the directors of Section 31. We're sorry we had to meet under these circumstances.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Me too.\" Ranma nervously said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis looked at Luna. He began to speak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain, something is wrong? Are the security officers scaring you?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No.\" Ranma cried.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo grabbed Ranma and put him in the corner. She began to speak. \"What you want?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We want to negotiate a way out of this that will work for everyone,\" Luna stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien eyed the pair of felines. Were they thinking about letting the crew of the Sisko live? He knew that could not happen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien slinked off and went into a turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay.\" Shampoo stated. \"Get rid of security team, we talk.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis shook his head. \"I can't do that until I am sure we are going to have compliance.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"If you no kill us, Shampoo guarantee compliance.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"First off,\" Luna said. \"Where is Lita?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina stood. \"She's in the brig. She turned herself over to us to be held accountable for the crimes of torture, kidnapping, and attempted murder of Starfleet Officers.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis looked at Luna. \"Very noble.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna nodded. \"We can assure you, Lita was not responsible for her actions, Mina.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis stepped forward. \"Mina, remember how I taught you that there are always two sides to every situation?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lita was the unfortunate victim of a failed memory implant.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She told us as much.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis continued. \"She had no real control over her actions. You know she always used to be angry and somewhat temperamental. Well, the implant had her acting on those feelings.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"In other words-\" Shampoo stated. \"She have no responsibility over what she do with Shampoo?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna shook her head. \"No. I promise you though when we find the captain of that ship he will be dealt with most severely.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo groaned. She really wanted revenge on the girl. She did understand though that if her mind was being messed with then she really couldn't hold her responsible. After all, if there was anyone who knew about messing with people's minds using one method or another, it was Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain,\" Luna called to the cowering Ranma. \"I do hope you will release Lita as soon as possible.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma regained his composure for a moment. \"Are you taking her back? It's been made very clear to me that she doesn't want to go back with you. I will not let you take someone against their will.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina just looked at the Captain. His sense of honor was something that she had grown to admire greatly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis shook his head. \"No. All I have ever wanted for her is for her to be happy - all of the girls. Lita was happy working for us. Not anymore. She can be with her friends on your ship if that is okay with you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You have the authorization to give her a field commission of Commander and place her in your crew.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What about them?\" Shampoo asked, pointing to the fleet of security guards on the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Again, once we are sure of compliance they will leave but we need to make sure of a couple of other things,\" Artemis replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You must delete any log entries of this encounter. You must delete all sensor data. Any personnel with detailed information of this encounter must be sworn to secrecy.\" Luna stated. \"If anyone talks about this, your entire crew will have to be terminated.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"Consider it done. What of Captain Giles?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Artemis sighed. \"He and his incompetent crew will be brought back to Earth and placed in new positions. I assure you they will be unharmed.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And Darien?\" Mina asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He will remain with Section 31. Regardless of anything else, he is still one of our best and more reliable operatives.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh- Sir &ndash; Ma'am-\" A security officer stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna turned to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"CB just transported to the Sisko.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna groaned. \"Captain, if you would retrieve him for me, I would be ever so grateful. You can use our security team if you wish.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I would just as well prefer that they vacate my ship,\" Ranma affirmed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Very well,\" Luna stated. She meowed some orders and the security team vanished. Ranma stood up. \"When we catch him, I'll call you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luna nodded and the transmission ended.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse ran up to his terminal and started to hit some buttons. Ranma started to speak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Computer, cancel procedure 213.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo issued an order to the computer. \"Intruder alert.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some alarm bells started to sound.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Found him.\" Mousse stated. \"He's working his way through the Jeffries tubes. Looks like he is heading to Engineering.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"Shampoo &ndash; Mousse.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both officers nodded and headed off to the turbo lift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mina, will you go get our guest out of the brig and assign her quarters?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh, one more thing,\" Ranma said as Mina stood. \"Let's let her relax for a while. Don't let her know about the commission.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded again and ran off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sat down in his chair. He looked to Ryouga.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You sure have been quiet, Ensign.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah well, why have you been avoiding Akane? Isn't she good enough for you anymore? And another thing &ndash;\" Ryouga was interrupted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I didn't say start talking.\" Ranma mused.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga turned back to his panel and mumbled some anti-Ranma swear words to himself.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "actions", "story": 3}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 17, "fields": {"chapter_number": 6, "title": "Resolution", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien grumbled to himself. He had quite enough of crawling through crawlspaces for one day. He knew though that he would meet too much resistance that he would not be ready for if he transported right into engineering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since that wouldn&rsquo;t work he figured he would transport into an area of the ship where there would be no one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most people on a battleship aren&rsquo;t really interested in looking at plants. So he transported himself into the arboretum. Unfortunately, he transported himself right on top of a Regalian Sting Bush. Now he had sting marks all over his legs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It&rsquo;s a small price to pay though he thought. He made it to the Jeffries tube with no resistance. As a matter of fact, he didn&rsquo;t even see one crew person.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He was working against time now though. They had discovered him and sounded an intruder alert. Now every single security officer on this ship had the sole purpose of stopping him. Considering this is a battleship that amounted to about 200 of the 500 plus crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien wasn&rsquo;t worried though. He knew that they were expecting him to attack the bridge. That&rsquo;s the control center of the ship. Darien&rsquo;s plan though wasn&rsquo;t to take control of this ship. His sole goal was the destruction of the Sisko. The quickest way of doing that would be via the engine room. One good high-level blast into the warp core would destroy the Sisko in about 20 seconds. Just long enough for him to transport off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He had hoped to find Lita first. Even though it was pretty obvious that she hated him, he still cared for her. He had once pondered the idea of a romantic relationship between the two of them, but she was too loyal to Serena to allow that to happen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It turned out for the best though. He had always had a thing for Raye. Once he realized that she had a thing for him too, well nature took its course.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He felt bad when he had to leave her. Section 31 had a deep cover assignment for him though. Even though he didn&rsquo;t like it that was the life he chose.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien slid out of the latest tube he was in and out into a junction point. He stretched out and looked at his PADD with a map of the Sisko. Another seventy-five meters and he would be in a thruster control room. There he would disable the Sisko&rsquo;s navigational thrusters, then storm engineering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien crawled into the next tube and began his slithering down it. It moved at a slight downward angle, so it was a lot less work to move down than the others.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He soon reached the end. He pulled one of his phasers out and had it ready to shoot anyone he saw. He opened the hatch and slid out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">No one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The room was empty. He peaked out of a window into main engineering. It was empty as well. He looked to the engine core.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shit.&rdquo; He said to himself. The containment bulkhead was down. He couldn&rsquo;t believe that the damage he did firing on the Sisko earlier could have been bad enough for the bulkhead to seal. He set down his hand phaser and grabbed his phaser rifle. He slinked out the door and checked all of engineering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Empty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien backed over to the bulkhead controls. He checked the status screen. The atmosphere on the other side of the bulkhead was fine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien punched in some buttons and raised the bulkhead. Suddenly Mousse, Shampoo, and about twenty security guards came from around the corner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien quickly powered up his rifle and pointed it at the dilithium chamber.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;If you shoot me I will still be able to fire,&rdquo; Darien stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;DROP YOUR WEAPON&rdquo; Mousse ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien smiled and started to lower his rifle. As the team moved in he shook his leg. A grenade fell out. Darien dove for cover as it beeped twice and exploded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The blast sent people flying in every direction. Several of Mousse&rsquo;s security officers are killed in the blast. Others seriously injured. Mousse managed to avoid the blast. He looks around.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;SHAMPOO?&rdquo; Mousse calls out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;MOUSSE!&rdquo; Shampoo called back from the far side of engineering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien had Shampoo pinned up against a wall with his rifle in one hand pointed at her and a tricorder in his other hand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;So, whatcha going to do?&rdquo; Darien gestured towards the warp core. On the dilithium chamber hatch, there was an explosive.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You can save your girlfriend here.&rdquo; Darien grinned. &ldquo;Or you can save your ship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;SHAMPOO NOT HIS GIRLFRIEND!&rdquo; Shampoo yelled, defiant to the very bitter end.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; Darien spat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse and a couple of the security officers that were remaining trained their weapons on Darien.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re insane!&rdquo; Mousse yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re confusing patriotism with insanity!&rdquo; Darien laughed. &ldquo;I SWORE to protect the Federation at all costs! Your crew has knowledge that they shouldn&rsquo;t have! That makes you all a threat. You must be eliminated.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Darien.&rdquo; Raye&rsquo;s voice called.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien only moved his eyes so he could see Raye standing off to his right. &ldquo;Hi Raye.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Darien. Please. Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She said, tears forming in her eyes. &ldquo;We can all get out of this and maybe make things back to the way they were before.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien shook his head. &ldquo;No, Raye. They cannot ever go back to the way they were before. I love you, but I have a duty.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Duty?&rdquo; Raye asked, almost mockingly. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t give a damn about duty when you ditched Serena for me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien just laughed. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t a duty.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Then what was it?&rdquo; Serena asked from behind Raye, her eyes narrow and full of anger, not something that was ever in Serena&rsquo;s bright blue eyes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Hey, meatball head.&rdquo; Darien grinned. &ldquo;Why would it be a duty? A person and their decisions make destiny. Would you have rather I stuck with you and then the both of us could enjoy a happy loveless life together?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The anger in Serena&rsquo;s eyes faded and was replaced by something she had become used to having in her eyes - pain. She began to cry. &ldquo;But I loved you!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my point! I didn&rsquo;t love you. Not for my lack of trying mind you. I put up with all of your nonsense. Dealt with all of the lousy grades, the whining, the jealousy, the saving your ass all the time. Why did it have to be about you all the time? Why couldn&rsquo;t I have what I want?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse decided to use the girls&rsquo; distraction to slink over to the bomb planted on the warp core. Darien saw this out of the corner of his eye, however.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Move one step closer and I waste the chick.&rdquo; He ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;MOUSSE STOP BOMB!&rdquo; Shampoo yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse was torn between the duty he had to protect the ship and his love for Shampoo. The love got the better of him and he stepped away from the bomb.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien grabbed Shampoo by the collar and threw her over to where Mousse was standing. He then hit one button on his tricorder and the bomb began to beep. A display showed they had twenty seconds.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Raye,&rdquo; Darien said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those words nailed Raye right through her heart. She could only drop to her knees and cry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena remained standing though. She drew her phaser and with her eyes now empty, shot Darien.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien grimaced in pain as the blast went through his entire body. He dropped the tricorder but held onto the phaser rifle. He fired it at Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse moved like lightning and knocked Shampoo to the ground. The blast went past them and hit the bomb. It sparked and blew up, knocking the remaining security officers out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The explosives in the bomb did not blow, however. They remained affixed to the warp core. The detonator, however, was destroyed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse knew what would happen next. A phaser shot to the raw explosives would end this. It would blow the warp core and the entire ship. Mousse began to run to Darien.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien turned to Serena and fired a shot. This at the same time as Serena fired a second shot. Darien&rsquo;s shot hit Serena in her side. She fell to the ground unconscious.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena&rsquo;s shot hit Darien in his left arm - the arm that he had been holding the phaser rifle in. Darien dropped the rifle. He then turned and saw Mousse charging at him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien reached inside of his jacket and pulled out one of his roses. He backhanded it at Mousse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse came to a stumble-stop as the rose penetrated his neck. He opened his mouth to cough. When he did, he coughed up blood.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse dropped to his knees. He was trying to speak but he couldn&rsquo;t. Every attempt only managed to spit up more blood. The rose pierced his larynx.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo screamed. She scrambled over to Mousse and pulled the rose out of his neck. She noticed that Darien was moving to pick up his rifle again. He was going to fire on the warp core.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo decided that was not going to be an option. She took the rose and with all her power threw it at Darien.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien screamed as the rose went deep into his chest. His eyes were wide open as he looked at Shampoo who was glowing red with fury. She slowly walked towards him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien tried his best to hold onto the rifle. He pointed it at Shampoo and fired.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The shot hit Shampoo dead center. Darien turned white when Shampoo did not fall, as she should have. His phaser was set on kill. She continued to walk towards Darien. Her fists clenched.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien fired again. Again the shot hit Shampoo dead center and she did not fall. Darien was starting to blackout. The rose had torn a hole in his lung. He could hardly breathe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien looked up and could see Shampoo still marching towards him. Shampoo was beginning to stagger, though. Darien felt that he had enough for two more shots. One-shot to kill the purple-haired Amazon and another to destroy the Sisko.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien brought his rifle to bear again. He began to move his thumb to the trigger when he was tackled from his right side.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye knocked Darien to the ground. She began to try and pry the rifle from his arms. She was having trouble though. She was weak from the heartbreak before.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Raye-&ldquo; Darien grunted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye ignored him. Unable to get the rifle from him she did the only thing left she could do.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye began to twist his arms and finally got it so the rifle was pointed right at Darien.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien looked into Raye&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I do still love you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A tear fell from Raye&rsquo;s eyes and landed on Darien&rsquo;s face. She then closed her eyes and pushed the trigger.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Darien let out a light scream as the blast hit him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye felt Darien&rsquo;s muscles relax and his grip let go of the rifle. She flung the rifle across the room. Never opening her eyes she leaned back and sat next to her former lover.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye finally opened her eyes and looked at Darien. His eyes were still open, void of all life. Raye looked right into his eyes and began to cry again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I-&ldquo; She stammered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She put her head down on his chest and cried.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo had fallen to her knees. She managed to crawl herself over to Mousse&rsquo;s limp, bloody body. She hit her communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shampoo to sickbay. Multiple medical emergency in engineering.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane&rsquo;s voice acknowledged the call and informed her that she was on her way.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo looked at Mousse. He was still breathing, though it was very faint. She took his hand. He looked up at her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Mousse.&rdquo; Shampoo said. Mousse smiled and tried to speak, but the damage to his voice box kept that from happening. Every breath brought up more blood.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse used every ounce of strength he had and leaned towards Shampoo slightly, placing his hand on his heart. He then slowly moved his hand and touched Shampoo&rsquo;s chest.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mousse then spit out his last blood-filled breath and went totally limp.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo began to cry. &ldquo;I love you too, Mousse.&rdquo; She cried and put her head on his chest and Akane and her medical crew began to fill the room.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Captain&rsquo;s log &ndash; Stardate 60109.5.

He did not care for having to note deaths. Especially the deaths of people that he felt close to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Lieutenant Mousse was also killed in action. May the record show that he fought bravely and died defending this ship and her crew.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma paused again. There would be no record. He knew that in accords with his agreement of Section 31 that no one must know of what happened. He figured that for the record he would make up some cock and bull story about a group of exiled Romulans that decided to try and take over the ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He would not let Mousse&rsquo;s death be in vain.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Memorial services will be held today at 21:00 hours.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>In regards to Lita Kino, I have not yet informed her about Section 31&rsquo;s decision.

She was in her full dress uniform. The uniform fit her very well. Ranma could not help but notice this.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Ranma stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane blushed and giggled. &ldquo;You think it looks okay? This is the first time that I&rsquo;ve worn it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded feverishly. &ldquo;You look &ndash; well, certainly not un-cute.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane shot Ranma a look that he gladly accepted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Seriously, Akane &ndash;&ldquo; Ranma continued. &ldquo;You look very good in that uniform.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Akane smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite the stud in your dress whites as well.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma grinned. &ldquo;Ready to go?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane lost her grin and shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never READY to go to these memorial services.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma also lost his grin. &ldquo;Please tell me everyone else is going to survive and that we won&rsquo;t have any more of these.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane sighed. &ldquo;Everyone except Ensign Stratton is stable. He&rsquo;s touch-and-go. The medical ships that we are rendezvousing with will have better equipment on board. If he makes it till then I am sure he will be fine.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. He made it a point to memorize the service records of every officer that was involved in the altercation. Stratton had been an enlisted crewman for six years when he decided to join the academy and become an officer. He fought in the Dominion War on the front lines. He had more medals for honor and courage than Ranma could even count.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;He will survive,&rdquo; Ranma said as he escorted Akane out of his ready room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the bridge, all of the third shift officers were on duty an hour early. Ranma decided to have a word with them before he left.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Everyone.&rdquo; Ranma cleared his throat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The entire bridge crew turned to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I am sorry that you won&rsquo;t be able to attend the memorial. Let me just make sure that your comrades know how much you appreciate their sacrifice. They all died bravely defending this ship. Never forget that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A few murmurs are heard and everyone nods their agreement to Ranma. He then turns back to Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane nods and the pair walk into the turbolift.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cargo bay was filled to capacity with Sisko crew. They all stood in several lines, all wearing dress uniforms. In front of them, towards the back of the cargo bay were seventeen caskets. Each casket was draped with the United Federation of Planets flag. Standing in front of the caskets, facing the crew was the senior staff of the Sisko. Mina, Shampoo, and Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the crowd were Gosnell and Lita. Gosnell was in his usual pipless Starfleet digs. Since he wasn&rsquo;t really part of Starfleet, he had no dress uniform. Lita was wearing a very nice outfit she had made.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita was very close to Gosnell and the pair were holding hands.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye turned to Mina. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Serena?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let her out of sickbay yet,&rdquo; Mina replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye sighed. &ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded and tightened her stance when she saw Ranma enter the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;CAPTAIN ON DECK!&rdquo; She yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The entire room stood at somewhat relaxed attention. Ranma walked up to the front and to a podium. Akane took her place as the new fifth in command between Mina and Raye, Serena being fourth in command, but absent, and Raye being sixth.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; Ranma said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We are here tonight to honor the memory of our fallen shipmates - Our crewmates, our friends who died defending this ship, and in turn, defending the Federation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;We all take an oath to protect the Federation even at the cost of our lives.

Now we add these seventeen, to be remembered by us and by generations to come.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A crewman hands Ranma a box with seventeen medals in it. Ranma places each one on each of the caskets except for Mousses. He walks over to Shampoo, whose eyes are filled with tears.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Shampoo,&rdquo; Ranma said, very quietly. &ldquo;You knew him longer than I did. Would you like to do the honor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo looked to Ranma and silently nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She took the award from Ranma and walked over to Mousse&rsquo;s casket. She placed it atop the casket and then dropped to her knees.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Stupid Mousse.&rdquo; She cried. &ldquo;Shampoo always loved you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She remained like that for a moment, then stood and walked back to her position. Ranma walked to her and put a hand on her shoulder. He then walked back to his podium.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;ALL HANDS, ATTENTION!&rdquo; He yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every person in the room simultaneously stood at full attention.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;DISMISSED!&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The room then began to empty out. Soon the only ones left in the room were Ranma, Akane, and Shampoo. Shampoo simply stood and looked at Mousse&rsquo;s coffin.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked over to Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Did you know-&ldquo; Akane stated. &ldquo;That prior to the fight I spent about thirty hours trying to figure out a way to relieve her from duty?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ranma asked. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane blushed and turned away. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s too clingy on you. It can&rsquo;t be healthy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shrugged. &ldquo;So what. You have nothing to worry about.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane turned back to Ranma. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma smiled at Akane and took her hand. &ldquo;Because I love you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane could only stare wild-eyed as Ranma leaned in and kissed her quite passionately.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once Ranma completed his kiss he tugged on Akane&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane was still pretty much speechless. &ldquo;Where-&ldquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Out here. It&rsquo;s sad in here. I want to be someplace happier.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane allowed Ranma to pull her out into the hallway.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo sighed as the pair left the room. She had seen the kiss.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;I need to know,&rdquo; Ranma said after the door to the cargo bay closed. &ldquo;Do you love me too?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane said nothing. She looked at her feet for a minute.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma frowned. Could it be she felt nothing for him?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma started to loosen his grip on Akane&rsquo;s hand. She in return tightened her grip on his hand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Akane said as she pulled Ranma&rsquo;s face to hers and kissed him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Down the hall, Gosnell was standing with Lita. They were watching the two. Gosnell grinned from ear to ear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Atta boy.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Are you going to ask him?&rdquo; Lita asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;NOW?&rdquo; Gosnell exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not breaking that up. No sir. That kiss, right there, is years in the making! Why I might as well go back in time and bitch slap DaVinci! It&rsquo;d have the same effect!&rdquo; Lita can only give the barkeeper a strange look that appeared to be confusion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;No worries babe. He&rsquo;ll do it. I am sure. Besides if he won&rsquo;t we can always just live in sin.&rdquo; Gosnell chuckled, but the look from Lita, one that was obviously not confusion, silenced him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Uh - We can ask in the morning. I promise.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita grinned at her love.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the pair started to walk off Gosnell took one last look. Ranma and Akane were still kissing. Gosnell laughed to himself as he walked off.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "resolution-mt2", "story": 3}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 18, "fields": {"chapter_number": 7, "title": "Epilogue", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And by the power vested in me by the Federation Council, I now pronounce you man and wife.

Gosnell gave a grin back and then moved in to kiss Lita - his new wife.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once the tonsil fishing was complete Gosnell turned back to Ranma. \"So, when is your turn coming up?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked over to Akane who was crying her eyes out. It's pretty obvious that this is a trait she had gotten from her father.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighed. \"I don't know. The admission was a task and a half itself. I can't even imagine the stress level of then asking her to marry me. Let alone going through with it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell grinned. He turned to Lita and smiled at her. He turned back to Ranma. \"It's worth it, Captain.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma grinned and nodded. He closed the Federation &lsquo;Marriage on Starships for Dummies' book he was using to officiate the wedding. He turned to Lita.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mrs. &ndash; Uh -\" Ranma looked to Gosnell. \"What the hell is your last name?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell stared off into space for a minute. \"I don't think I have one. I'm kind of like Madonna or Cher or The Rock.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hrm.\" Ranma groaned. \"Well then Mrs. Kino.\" Lita grinned at him. \"After the honeymoon, we'll talk about a position for you here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita's eyes widened. \"A position?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"L &amp; A &ndash;\" Ranma choked when he realized that he had just used their Section 31 names. \"Luna and Artemis said that you have been reintegrated into normal old Starfleet and that you could stay here with your friends and new husband. I have been authorized to give you a field commission to the rank of Commander.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita and Gosnell shared a kiss again. Lita giggled. Ranma bowed his head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I have a tactical officer/chief of security position open. You'd be fourth in command of the ship. It's yours if you want it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita gave Ranma a comforting smile. \"He didn't die in vain.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma raised his head and nodded. \"Like I said, after the honeymoon.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita's grin just got bigger. Gosnell's did as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The newlyweds looked at each other and nodded. They proceeded to walk down the aisle while the spectators showered them with fake, environmentally safe rice.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina, Lita's maid of honor, walked into the aisle and followed them. Ryouga, Gosnell's best man, also turned down the aisle and walked next to Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sighed. Ryouga watched her out of the corner of his eye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Always a bride's maid, never a bride.\" Mina whimpered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga put his hand on her shoulder. \"Come on. A super hot chick like you won't be single forever. You just haven't found anyone good enough for you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina smiled at Ryouga as the two followed the couple down and out of the dining hall.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma cleared his throat. \"Reception in 10-Forward.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">No one seemed to move.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma cleared his throat again. \"Free drinks.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The room was cleared in mere seconds. The only one left sitting in her seat was Akane. She looked up at Ranma and smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Should we tell them?\" She asked, playing with the wedding band on her finger.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head. \"This is Lita and Gosnell's moment. No need to step on that.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane smiled. Ranma continued. \"Besides, I really have no interest in this ship being damaged further by an insane Ryouga.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane laughed. \"Wanna get drunk?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma grabbed her arm and ran out of the door with her. \"You have to ask?\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">10-Forward was a party zone. People were drinking, dancing, making out, and pretty much making as big of asses of themselves as possible. It was just a good old-fashioned wedding reception.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena, completely healed from her wounds, was doing her normal &lsquo;what the hell is that?' dance. Raye was pounding drinks and taking turns hitting on either the boys or the girls. It was really a whoever was the closest thing. Raye knew if she stood up to hit on anyone she'd become very acquainted with the carpeting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina was getting pretty hammered herself. She was sitting at a table with Ryouga. Ryouga was slamming them as fast as the waiter could bring them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma and Akane were over in the corner drinking and chatting. Akane had what appeared to be a never-ending look of bliss on her face. She was happy. So much happier than she had been in a very long time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma was talking about something. Who knows what because when he's been drinking he just talks. Not really about anything in particular. She knows that she heard the words &lsquo;water, silk, plasma, and Baywatch' in the same sentence, so she knew if she zoned out for a bit he really wouldn't notice.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She took the time to scan the room. She smiled and giggled when she saw Serena dancing. She was glad that she was feeling well enough to twist and contort her body in such odd positions. She giggled a little more when she saw Raye grabbing at two of her nurses. One male and one female. She smiled when she saw Ryouga and Mina sitting together - sitting a lot closer together now than when they first got there. She smiled when she saw Gosnell and Lita slow dancing by the window, Lita resting her head on Gosnell's chest, the two of them dancing very slowly even though it was an upbeat song. She realized they were just so happy to be holding each other nothing else really mattered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She scanned the room again. There were lots of people that she knew by seeing them, but didn't know their names. She did notice one person who was not there.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"- my dad said - &lt;hic&gt; Mr. Tendo loved her - &lt;hic&gt; and pop goes - &lt;hic&gt; the weasel?\" Ranma stammered. Akane scowled at him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where's Shampoo?\" She queried.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked around before he realized that he knew the answer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh &ndash; She want bridge be on.\" Ranma slurred.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh.\" Akane frowned for the first time that day.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo was slumped down in the captain's chair. She sat there staring at the starfield whisking past the ship as it headed towards Starbase 332 for minor repairs and replacement crew members.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo's eyes were empty. She had never felt so much pain and sadness before in her life. Not only had she lost someone that she did care about, but she never bothered to tell him how she felt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not until it was too late.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It wasn't until after it happened that she realized her post-mortem confession hurt her more than it helped her. Saying &lsquo;I love you' to the man who died protecting her after the fact hurt her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo sighed. The stars were hypnotic. All she could do was stare at them. Just like many others who have sat in that chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The stars were an escape.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The stars didn't judge her. They didn't remind her how cruel she always was to him. They didn't remind her of all the times she phasered him after he glomped onto some random crew person thinking they were her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo chuckled at that thought. She couldn't remember once when he got it right. She remembered him mistaking Ranma for her. She remembered him mistaking Akane for her. She could even remember him mistaking her two-foot-tall great grandmother for her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She chuckled again &ndash; this one seeming a little bit more forced.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She told herself that she would not cry. Not on the bridge of all places.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She sniffled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you okay?\" A female voice brought Shampoo out of her trance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"A-Akane.\" Shampoo stuttered. \"Why you no at party?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane looked at the stars and back to Shampoo. \"Ranma's passed out.\" Akane grinned at the memory of having to get security to drag his unconscious body back to his quarters. She quickly lost her grin though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I &ndash;\" Akane was lost on how to phrase this. The two of them had been rivals for Ranma for so long. This was the person that just seven days ago she was plotting against.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This wasn't the time for rivalries though. Shampoo was in pain. Akane wasn't experienced with this type of pain, but she did know pain.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I was worried about you.\" Akane continued.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo sighed and turned back to the viewscreen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo be okay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane watched the Amazon for a few seconds. She then put her hand on Shampoo's shoulder. Shampoo sniffled again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane stood and slowly walked back to the turbolift. She paused to take a look at the tactical station. She looked at the Lieutenant manning the station. She stared at the black armband he and all other members of the Sisko's security detail were wearing. She sighed and turned back to the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane &ndash;\" Shampoo called from her seat, never turning away from the viewer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane turned around. \"Yes ma'am?\" She stated, surprising herself. She had never before cared about the fact that Shampoo was her Commanding Officer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane. Thank you.\" Shampoo finished.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane smiled to herself, then turned and boarded the lift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Deck four.\" She ordered as the lift doors closed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo allowed herself to slump down farther. She closed her eyes and silently cried.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A fairly annoying beeping noise awoke Mina from one of those very deep had-too-damn-much-to-drink sleeps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina leaned over her bed and hit a button on her nightstand. The beeping stopped and the computer began to speak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good morning, Mina.\" The computer said. \"It's 06:00 hours! You have one hour to get dressed and to your post.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ugh,\" Mina complained. Mina pulled the covers off of her and slid out of bed. She noticed something was wrong right away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm naked?\" She asked herself. Mina never slept naked. She was always worried that they would have to abandon the ship in the middle of the night and she would be forced into an escape pod before she could grab any clothes. It was silly but that's the way she felt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina decided to shrug it off. She came to the conclusion that she was just so tired and drunk that she slid out of her dress uniform and her Starfleet issue underwear, and then fell asleep before she could put on her usual boxer shorts and a tee-shirt.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina groggily walked into the bathroom and put toothpaste on her toothbrush. She brushed her teeth for about 10 minutes before realizing that she was standing there in the dark.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lights &ndash; 30 percent.\" Mina sputtered. The computer complied and the lights came on, albeit dim. Mina squinted though. Her hangover decided that 30 percent was still too damn bright.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina knew that she couldn't get ready for work with it any darker though so she dealt with it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The blonde gargled some water to rinse the toothpaste out of her mouth. She spat it out. She looked in the mirror. She noticed something in her hair that wasn't her normal red bow.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"A bandana?\" She queried.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She could remember hanging around with Ryouga most of the night. She came to the conclusion that he had given it to her as a gift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sure was nice of him.\" Mina grinned as she stepped into her sonic shower. She activates it and spends about 10 minutes in it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina steps out and walks back to the mirror. She sighs. \"Sure do miss water showers.\" She grumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina walks out of the bathroom and over to a dresser where she gets some underwear and puts it on. She then walks over to her closet and finds a uniform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once dressed Mina walks to her full-length mirror and takes a look at herself. All she needed to do now was put her red bow in her hair and apply her communicator and her pips.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She walks over towards her dresser and trips on a pair of boots. They weren't hers. These were men's boots.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Who the hell do these belong to?\" She asked herself not expecting to hear an answer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She got one though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you have to make so much noise?\" A male voice called from her bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two plus two never added up so fast before in her life.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"ENSIGN HIBIKI?\" Mina screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga shot right up in the bed and looked around. He looked at Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Co-Co-Co-Co-\" Ryouga stuttered. He looked underneath the covers and started to blush.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RYOUGA!\" Mina screamed again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga looked at her. \"Why are you in my quarters?!\" Ryouga exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina simply glared at him. \"YOU are in my quarters. IN MY BED!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga freaked out when he realized what was going on.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"COMMANDER! SORRY!\" Ryouga hopped out of the bed and bolted out the door. Naked as the day he was born.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina dug around and found her communicator. \"Commander Aino to Sickbay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am?\" A tech said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am going to be in there in a few minutes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's wrong?\" The tech asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina blushed. \"I need the shot.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina glowered when she heard the tech laugh. \"Better hurry before we run out. A lot of people have been getting the shot this morning.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shook her head. \"Understood. Aino out.\" She hit her communicator again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina remembered the captain told her about Ryouga's sense of direction. She'd seen it first hand from the times he'd gotten them lost in space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander Aino to Security.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am.\" A male voice asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You need to find Ensign Hibiki and take him to his quarters. He's running around the ship naked.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina just shook her head when she heard not only the officer who answered the call laugh but several other people in the background laughing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am.\" The officer snorted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina grumbled as she hit her communicator to end the communication. She grumbled as she walked out the door. She grumbled all the way to sickbay. She grumbled all the way up to the bridge. She grumbled the whole day long.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, somewhere in Engineering, Serena was screaming.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Engineering is no place for a naked man to be!

The beaches are full of half-naked men and women. Kids are playing in the baseball park. Old ladies are feeding the pidgins. Old men are playing chess. No one seemed to have a care in the world.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even the police are out basking in the sun. They don't have much to do.

It seems that each slurp sounds like it's actually saying something.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Loser.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor shakes his head and decides that at least one of these people is going to be as miserable as him.

I thought you wanted to meet at the tea house! Not the T-intersection!\" he says.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor just rolls his eyes as he begins to walk away. He halts though when he heard the girl scream one of those happy screams. He turns.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I will marry you!\" She spouts. \"And not just because you just won the lottery!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor clenches a fist and walks down the street.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"When, oh when will the Gods decide it's time for I to have a girlfriend?\" Trevor ponders out loud as he walks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm a stud muffin! I should have fifteen girls! But no, I can't even get one! My mother even turned me down for prom!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor sighed as he walked past an arcade where a couple inside is too busy making out to pay attention to their game. Trevor continues down the street.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And now here I am, stuck on THIS planet of all planets.\" He reminds himself. \"Blasted Klingon repair shops!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor turns his head while continuing to walk and he sees a store that teaches martial arts. However, no one inside is fighting. Trevor can only sigh once again when he notices all inside are busy making out with each other.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor continues his rambling. \"I deserve happiness! I deserve to be at peace! I helped save this quadrant from the Dominion! I took a disrupter to the ass! Got the Starfleet Purple Heart! And for my discharge what do I get? A crap-ass, non-working P-O-S Runabout.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A beeping emanates from Trevor's pocket. He pulls out his communicator. It looks like an old-school Starfleet communicator. You know, the flip open, beam me up Scotty kind.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor flips it open. \"Computer, report.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer begins to talk to him. It's not the normal Starfleet computer voice though. This computer has the voice of someone very familiar. Someone with what could be described as having an English accent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor, a Starfleet ship has entered the sector!\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Could something right actually be happening today? \"Are they responding to the distress call?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor, I told you the communications array was offline. I could not transmit the distress call.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Guess not. \"Will it be fixed before they leave the sector?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It should be! I am trying 10 EPS re-routs per minute! I will eventually get it to work!\" The computer replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Very well. Can you identify the ship?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The best I can do&hellip;\" The computer explains. \"&hellip;is the class. It's a Sovereign Class.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thanks.\" Trevor closes his communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He continues to walk down the street. He starts to feel hungry so he decides to go and get some food. He was able to replicate the local currency before he left his disabled runabout.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Let's see, pasta or fish. What do I feel like today? I think that my lonely heart could use some Alfredo sauce!\" Trevor begins to walk across the street when a police officer yells at him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Excuse me, sir!\" The officer says, running up to Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am afraid that I am going to have to place you under arrest.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT?\" Trevor screamed. \"Why? What did I do? I have the green light!\" Trevor franticly points to the traffic light, which at that exact moment turns red. Trevor scowls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, sir, we have to arrest people who talk to themselves. It's a mental health guideline.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I wasn't talking to myself,\" Trevor explains. \"It was a soliloquy.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The policeman laughs. \"No sir, I am a literature major and that was not a soliloquy. At best that was haiku.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, that's what it was then. A haiku.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Haiku's are illegal also sir.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor just groans in submission as the policeman places him in handcuffs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You must hate having to work on a nice day like this, huh?\" Trevor asks the officer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No sir. I love my job!\" The happy policeman states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor groans again. \"Well, do you guys at least have pasta at the jail?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes sir! All you can eat!\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor grins as he is placed in the back of a police car.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Unfortunately &ndash; \" The cop finishes as he shuts the door and gets into the driver's seat. \"You are not going to jail. You are going to the mental health building downtown. You can get SPAM sandwiches there!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor just cries as he bangs his head against the prisoner partition of the police car.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A COOL, SEMI PLAGIARIZED STAR TREK TYPE THEME SHOULD BE INSERTED HERE,&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">THIS TIME ONE WITH WORDS LIKE ON ENTERPRISE!

Akane quickly responded with a fist to the nose, followed by a glare. \"Yeah, that one,\" Ranma murmured.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane laughed. \"When do you think it happened?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"After the wedding &ndash; Lita and Gosnell's &ndash; is when I noticed the change.\" Ranma started to laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Akane asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She threw him out of her quarters naked!

Akane covered her mouth and turned and hit Ranma once again. \"That wasn't nice!\" She said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma continued to laugh. \"I'm not the one who said &lsquo;eww'!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane just grumbled and turned towards the window and closed her eyes. \"Hurry up and finish that damned log.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma giggled a few more times and continued.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Ryouga has nothing to worry about though.

The computer chirped. \"Set wake-up time for 07:00.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer chirped in compliance and Ranma rolled over wrapped his arm around his wife, kissed her once, and fell fast asleep.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I AM NOT AVOIDING YOU!\" Ryouga yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina just continued to glare at him. \"I'm late. The shot may not have worked. You need to be a man and do the right thing.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What? Marry you?\" Ryouga asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don't be a moron.\" Mina scowled. \"Deposit one-third of your paycheck into my account.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"ONE THIRD?\" Ryouga screamed again. Several of the other patrons in ten forward looked towards the pair, but one look from Mina changed the direction of their stares.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's the least you could do, considering you got me drunk, seduced me, and knocked me up,\" Mina stated dryly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I DID NOT SEDUCE YOU!\" Ryouga yelled, this time flailing his arms. The patrons of the bar again looked in their direction but this time it was Ryouga's look that got them to turn away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, there is no other reason I would sleep with a subordinate, ENSIGN,\" Mina stated quite matter-of-factly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga lowered his eyes and grinned ever so slightly. \"So, you're saying that if we were the same rank you might go out with me?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina was thrown off by this question.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Maybe.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga's grin widened. \"See, I didn't seduce you. You wanted it. You wanted some of this all along. Big poppa Ryouga was on your mind from the very beginning.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina promptly sent Ryouga flying across the room and walked out. Ryouga simply lied on the floor and laughed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He stopped though when he realized the exact reality of the situation. He couldn't afford a child. What if she was pregnant? They couldn't tell for sure yet though. The shot always messes with a woman's cycle. She could simply be late as a side effect of the shot.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga sat up and groaned. He was going to have to get her into sickbay for a test. He knew that she didn't want to though. She didn't want any chance in anyone knowing that she slept with him. He wasn't sure why though. Just looking around ten-forward Ryouga determined that she could do worse. A lot worse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga also acknowledged to himself that he really didn't want Akane knowing that he had slept with her. She'd never want him if she was just going to be his sloppy seconds. The pig-boy sighed, stood, and walked out of the ships watering hole.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Behind the bar, Gosnell was laughing. His wife, Commander Lita Gosnell, was sitting across from him. The pair watches Ryouga leave the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Naked you say?\" Gosnell asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yup,\" Lita replied. \"I wasn't working yet at the time but from what I heard he was kicked out of her quarters-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Naked?\" Gosnell asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, naked,\" Lita confirmed somewhat annoyed. \"Then he got lost and was wandering around the ship.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Naked,\" Gosnell stated. Lita smacked him with a menu.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He was in engineering, shuttle bay seven, and then ended up in torpedo control.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ah yes. Where he got-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita smiled. \"Stuck. Yeah.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell just laughed again. \"You know, I haven't known that guy long but I gotta tell you. I love him! Comedy relief of the ship.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nodded. She shoved her glass across the bar. Gosnell filled it up with a bubbly green colored liquid.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What is this again?\" Lita asked, taking a drink.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's called Mountain Dew,\" Gosnell stated. \"It's become very rare ever since the great sugar prohibition of 2204.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I like it! It's woken me up quite a bit!\" Lita giggled, pushing her now empty glass back to her husband.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now, now. I don't think you need much more. This stuff will make you wired and that's never good for someone with their finger on the proverbial trigger.\" Gosnell explained, taking her glass away and giving her some water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Bah!\" Lita groaned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita spins on her bar stool for a couple of turns as her husband walks away. Lita's been very happy the last two months. She's gotten married, gotten a new job, and gotten to see Ryouga's mini P-Chan pulled from a torpedo exhaust intake valve.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She wasn't working at the time, as she said, but when she heard what was going on she HAD to go see it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah, she smiled to herself, life doesn't get much better.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It doesn't take much for her to remember back to the worse times though. Back to when she thought she was happy. Back when she was robbing, stealing, and shooting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita sighs and shakes off the memory. They have been coming back to her in greater frequency lately, but she hasn't really thought anything of it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The double doors to ten-forward hiss open. Lita spins around a couple of times more and looks towards the doors. (Lita really likes to spin in her chair!) She hops off and smiles when she sees who enters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good morning! Li-Li!\" Serena smiles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita gives her friend a hug. The pair sits down at the bar. Lita sternly looks at Serena.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You know I hate it when you call me Li-Li.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena giggles. \"You don't hate it when Gosnell calls you Li-Li.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell turns to the girls upon hearing his voice. \"Huh?\" Lita grins at her husband and smacks the top of his head with a newspaper that was conveniently left in the next seat. Gosnell sobs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT?!\" He whines.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don't call me Li-Li.\" Lita grins.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am.\" Gosnell salutes. Lita swings at Gosnell again, but he avoids it and smiles at Serena.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"GOOD MORNING!\" Serena yells.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell flips over backward and falls to the floor. He slowly gets back up and groans.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh, good morning, Commander. You seem very perky this morning.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena giggles. \"I had a great sleep last night. I got me something that I have needed for quite a while!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's Lita who falls out of her seat this time. \"You don't mean-?\" She whimpers from the deck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I do.\" Serena giggles. (Insert semi-dramatic pause here!) \"My new Cat Girl Nuku Nuku comic!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita, who had just managed to get back to her seat, falls out of it once again and Gosnell tumbles over. Gosnell is the first to recover.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That's great, Commander. Would you like your usual?\" Gosnell grins.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes please!\" Serena grins.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell nods and walks away. Lita gets back up and returns to her seat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So how's work, Serena?\" Lita asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena sighs. \"It's okay. I haven't caused any explosions.\" Serena hangs her head. \"This week.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita pats her friend on the back. Gosnell returns with a bowl. He places it in front of Serena. He then pulls out a box of Lucky Charms. He pours them into the bowl and then pours some milk on it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena grins. \"Thank you!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell nods and walks off to tend to the other customers. Serena starts to chomp on her cereal. She's had a decent couple of months as well. She hasn't caused any accidents that have required major evacuations. She's gotten new quarters after hers caught fire while she was in the shower. Seems she left her curling iron sitting atop her paper towel collection.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On an additional note, Serena now takes a towel into the shower with her. She was quite embarrassed walking out of the shower, naked of course, and into a room full of firefighters and security personal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena takes another spoon full of her cereal and looks around. She doesn't see Mina, but that's understandable. She starts work an hour earlier than Serena. She also doesn't see Raye. That doesn't surprise her either.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye has kept to herself since the events that led to her killing her first and only love.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye's quarters are completely dark. The only light coming in is from the running light, annoyingly placed right outside of her deck four quarters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A beeping noise starts. Some glass is heard shattering and then the beeping stops.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shit,\" Raye mumbles. \"Lights!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The room illuminates. Raye's quarters are trashed. There are clothes, PADDs, and bottles all over the place. Raye's normally organized desk is in utter chaos.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye slowly slides out of her bed. She walks over to her nightstand and takes a long look in the mirror. She's very disappointed in what she sees.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye's self-confidence has gone right down the drain since that fateful day two months ago. She no longer wears makeup. She no longer bothers to make sure her long black hair is in perfect condition. She now just places it in a ponytail and ties it back with a rubber band.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye, frankly, just doesn't give a damn.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why should I?\" Raye finally asks herself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She mopes into the bathroom and showers. She mopes over to her closet and gets dressed for work. She mopes over to her desk and flings the crap that was on her chair to the floor. She picks up a PADD and looks it over.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye studies the PADD for several minutes. She finally growls at it and throws it across the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That's not right at all.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye grumbles again and walks out of her quarters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This walk has become a morning ritual for her and some of the other crew members that live on deck four, section eight, near her. They have learned what they need to do if they see Raye coming.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hide.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One crewman starts to walk out of his quarters as Raye comes walking by.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"By honey! I love you!\" He calls into his quarters as he starts to walk out. He suddenly notices Raye standing there. The crewman's eyes go white. He quickly turns and runs back into the quarters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors slide shut and a locking chirp is heard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye shakes her head and sighs. She walks up to the turbolift to find another man standing there waiting for the lift. The man looks at her and smiles. He then returns his attention to waiting for the elevator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye cocks her head and watches him for a moment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He must be new. He hasn't run in terror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The crewman turns back to her. He smiles again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, Commander, I am new.\" He smiles. Raye looks bug-eyed at him. \"And even if I wasn't I doubt I would run in terror. Not really my style.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm also Betazed.\" He offers his hand. Raye takes it and they shake. \"Lt. Jeff Fuchs.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What do you do here?\" Raye asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm the new assistant to the ship's counselor.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye takes a step back. \"Assistant?\" Raye was unaware that they had hired her an assistant.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yup.\" Jeff nods. \"I'm on my way up to her office now.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye grins. The turbolift opens. The pair walks in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Deck Eight.\" They both say in unison.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You're going that way too, eh?\" Jeff asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They ride in silence for the quick ride down to deck eight. When the doors open they both walk out. They walk down the hall and stop at the door to Raye's office. Jeff walks up to the doors, but they do not open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Doors locked.\" The computer helpfully tells him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I guess she's not in yet!\" Jeff laughs. Raye smiles, steps past him, enters in her code, and the doors open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She doesn't usually get in until 07:30 on Mondays.\" Raye smiles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff laughs and the pair walks in.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo sighed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The slow-moving stars on the viewscreen were becoming very boring. She was getting very sick of watching the same star hardly move at all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo hated impulse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The warping stars had become her escape when she was on the bridge. Her escape from the memories; her escape from reality.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo had gotten back to normal for the most part over the past two months. She had finally come to terms with Mousse's death. And she was beginning to come to terms with Ranma's marriage to Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pair had not made it public, but after Shampoo saw them kissing after the memorial service she had made a point to keep checking their personal records. She knew she didn't have access to Ranma's record, but she could easily access Akane's.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo sighed again. She sat up in her seat and turned towards the helmsman. Ryouga was not in yet, so she wasn't worried about getting lost if she wanted to go for a little joyride.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Helm!\" Shampoo yelled. \"Do loop-de-loop!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman turned to Shampoo. Mina does as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Loop-de-loop?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah!\" Shampoo stands and demonstrates what a loop-de-loop is with her hands.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am.\" The helmsman acknowledged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ship starts to move forward very quickly. Shampoo sits back down and smiles as the stars start moving again. The ship then pitches the stern up 45 degrees. After a few seconds, the ship is back the way it was, one loop-de-loop complete. Shampoo claps and giggles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now do a barrel roll.\" Shampoo ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman looks over to Mina's station. Mina just shrugs and the helmsman complies. The ship completes several barrel rolls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo pleased!\" Shampoo states, walking to the helmsman and patting him on the back. \"Now, do both!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman is starting to get into the spirit of things. He giggles and starts to move the ship forward, increasing the speed. The ship pitches upwards and begins the loop-de-loop.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Helm hits a few more buttons and the ship starts to roll. The starts begin spinning in every which direction.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Meanwhile, in ten-forward:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell?\" Gosnell says, pointing towards the windows. Serena and Lita both turn and look out the window. They see the odd direction that the stars are spinning in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh-\" Serena mumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Meanwhile in Ranma and Akane's quarters:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma smiles as he finishes getting dressed. He starts to pat his hair while looking in the mirror. You know, to get it to sit straight. Ranma stops though when he sees the reflection of the stars in the mirror.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma slowly turns towards the window to confirm that he's not having a hallucination. Once that is established he calls for Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hey, Akane.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane walks back in with a sandwich in her mouth and a glass of water in her hand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"MUMF?\" She mumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma points to the window.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane looks. The sandwich falls out of her mouth. \"What the hell?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma hits his communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Saotome to Bridge?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">On the bridge:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh oh.\" Shampoo mumbles to herself. \"Yes, Ranma?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's going on?\" Ranma's voice asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nothing! All fine!\" Shampoo turns to the helmsman. \"ALL STOP!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman complies and the ship slams to a stop.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SON OF A BITCH!\" A female voice, that's not Akane's, is heard screaming through the comm. system.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo quickly looks around, and then to Mina. \"Shampoo on break. You have bridge.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo quickly runs to the turbolift and disappears.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Back in Ranma's quarters:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane can just stand there, her glass of water empty. She looks to Ranma-chan who just fumes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Son of a bitch.\" She grumbles.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "status", "story": 4}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 21, "fields": {"chapter_number": 2, "title": "Old Friends", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the very tip of Sector Zulu 771, a starship warps by. The starship is a Sovereign-class, the same kind of ship that was the USS Enterprise. Her sleekness slicing right through space. Moving at a comfortable warp 7 was the U.S.S. Crossroads.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On her bridge the first officer, Commander Ark Madcock was sitting in the captain's chair. He had some easy listening music playing out of the armrest console. He had his eyes closed but was not asleep. His hand was lightly tapping the armrest to the beat of the music.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Commander Madcock was a chubby man who had a thin mustache. He was also one of the few people in the Federation who opted to wear glasses rather than get the surgery to correct his vision. He felt that the glasses gave him that distinguished look. Most people who knew him though just thought he was a nerd.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The operations officer, Ensign Sai Vong seemed to be half asleep at his station. He was trying his best to listen to the music that was coming out of the command console.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ensign Vong was an Asian man, pretty short but very muscular. He had short, spiky hair. He was leaning back against the rear wall of his station.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why don't I get a chair?\" He asked anyone who would listen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The tactical officer looked at him. \"I don't get one either.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Commander Madcock never opened his eyes. \"It's because you two need to be alert. If they give you a chair you might fall asleep. Especially on days like this.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vong sighed and leaned back as much as he could without falling. He crossed his arms and started to hum along with the music.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was until a beeping from the sensors console brought him completely upright.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander?\" Vong asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The commander opened one eye. \"Yeah?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We have an M class planet on sensors.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The commander opened another eye. \"Way out here?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ensign nodded. \"Yes sir. Appears to be orbiting around Zima Prime.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I see.\" The commander acknowledged. He hit his console and stopped the music. He then tapped his comm. badge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Madcock to Captain Mizuno.\" He called. \"Please report to the bridge.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Acknowledged.\" A voice called. It was the same voice that Trevor had for the voice of his computer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a few moments, the door to the Captain's ready room opened, and onto the bridge walked Ami Mizuno. The final Sailor Scout. The only one of the five not to be with the others.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami walked up and looked at the commander. \"What's going on?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ensign?\" The commander ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ma'am, I've detected an M class planet orbiting Zima Prime,\" Vong replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Way out here?\" Ami repeated her first officer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ensign just shrugged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well then, I think we'd better check it out, don't you think?\" Ami replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Madcock nodded and hopped out of his boss's seat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Helm. Divert course. 2-3-2 mark 0-0-9.\" Ark ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aye!\" The helmsman replied. The ship adjusted its heading and continued warping towards the planet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami plopped down into her seat. She looked at her armrest console.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She then turned to Ark.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I see you changed my station again.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ark hung his head. \"They don't have that function on my chair.\" Ark points to the tactical display on the first officer's console.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"At least you get a chair.\" Vong whimpered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"HEY!\" Ark yelled. \"Don't make me come back there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sorry Commander,\" Vong replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ark nodded at him acknowledging that it was all good.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami hit some buttons. \"This will make the day go a little faster.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some music started. Ami smiled at Ark. Ark smiled back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shall we?\" Ark asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami nodded. The bridge crew began to sing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Helm: \"I've been driving all night my hands wet on the wheel&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tactical: \"There's a voice in my head that drives my heel&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vong: \"It's my baby calling says I need you here!!!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ark: \"And it's&hellip;\" Ark looks at the clock. \"&hellip;half-past eight and I'm shiftin' gear!!!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami: \"When she gets lonely and the longing gets too much, she sends a cable coming in from above &ndash; don't need a phone at all!!!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone: \"We've got a thing that's called Radar Love &ndash; We've got a wave in the air&hellip; Radar Love&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami smiles. \"Ah, classical music. What better way to fly to some forgotten planet in the middle of freakin' nowhere.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ark nods.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor sat and looked out the window that separated him from the outside world. Trevor was becoming very frustrated being locked away like he was. He decided that if he was going to be miserable he was going to make someone else just as miserable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">How to do that though. Trevor really wasn't in the best position to hit or kick anyone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He didn't really think he could anyway. After all the drugs they pumped into him at the mental health facility.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor realized how lucky he was that this civilization didn't do DNA testing and they looked just like humans. He can just imagine what they would do to him if they found out he was an alien.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That's it!\" He grins. \"Earth music will annoy them! But which song do I sing?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor thought back. He was big on the musical history of Earth. He had tracks from the early 1500's all the way to the beeping music craze of 2333.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor grins when he remembers one song in particular. The song that he was told that he ruined every time he tried to sing it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You wouldn't think that drunken people in a Mars karaoke bar would be so critical.\" He grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor took a deep breath.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She's into superstitions, black cats and voodoo dolls&hellip;\" Trevor sang, very off-key.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no response from anyone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"UPSIDE, INSIDE OUT &ndash; SHE'S LIVIN' LA VIDA LOCA!\" He bellowed, even louder and even more off key.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still nothing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell?\" Trevor asked himself. He gets up and walks over to the bars. He does his best to look around.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hello?\" He calls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Jesus Christ they all went home,\" Trevor grumbles and he returns to his seat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A beeping noise starts to emanate from his pocket. He sticks his hand in there and pulls out his communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good thing the fuzz didn't take this away from me!\" Trevor grins. He opens up the unit. \"Yes?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor.\" The Ami-sounding computer voice says. \"First, you shouldn't talk to yourself. That's how you got arrested in the first place. And second, I have the communications unit working and I am sending out a distress call.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor grumbles at the nagging but grins at the news of the working communication system. \"Excellent. Beam me outta here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer voice sighs. \"I can't.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT?\" Trevor screams.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I JUST got the communications systems working. It's going to take me well over an hour to reroute enough EPS junctions to get the transporters working.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Bloody hell! What am I supposed to do until then?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well&hellip;\" The computer replies. \"Remember, you have the right to remain silent. I suggest doing that.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The communication is cut off. Trevor grumbles and throws his communicator in anger. He screams when he sees it hit the opposite wall and shatter into hundreds of pieces.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aw damn it!\" Trevor whimpers. He walks over to where the shattered pieces are and fruitlessly attempts to reassemble them. He works on that for a few moments and then gives up, chucking the pieces into the jail cell's toilet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Troubles?\" A male voice asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor turns to the other side of the cell where he sees a man sitting wearing a Starfleet uniform. The man appears to be translucent.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"HOLY SHIT! Where did you come from?\" Trevor yelps, while trying to climb the wall in a feeble attempt to get away from the ghostly figure.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I've always been here, Trevor.\" He smiles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor just stares at him for a moment. Then faints.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"-And what have I told you about emergency stops? You know that I am always near water when you do that!\" Ranma-Chan yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Ranma's ready room, Ranma was standing behind her desk. Shampoo was sitting in the chair directly across from her. She was watching her feet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo sorry. Please don't be mad.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma-Chan sighed and sat down. \"I'm not mad at you. It's just; you can't be doing these stunts with the ship. It's dangerous. I know that you are bored. I'm bored! Shit these missions suck! But we still need to be careful.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo nodded. \"Anything else?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma-Chan shook her head. \"No.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo nodded once again and stood. She walked to the doors but stopped just shy of where they would open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma-Chan looked up. Shampoo continued to look at the doors.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"When were you going to tell Shampoo that you and Akane got married?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma-Chan fell out of her seat. \"What?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo sniffled. \"Shampoo hurt that you no tell.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma-Chan stood up. \"We're not.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo just shook her head. \"Don't lie. I saw file.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You can't access my file.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, but can access Akane's.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma-Chan sighed and walked over to Shampoo. She placed her hand on Shampoo's shoulder but Shampoo adjusted herself slightly, causing Ranma to remove her hand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I didn't want to upset you anymore. After what happened to Mousse-\" Ranma-chan cut herself off. \"I wanted to protect you from being any more hurt.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo laughed and continued walking. The doors slid open. \"Shampoo no need you to protect me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo walked off across the bridge and plopped down into the captain's chair. Ranma-Chan just sighed. She looked around the bridge. At her tactical station was Lita. She was keeping an eye on the tactical station but was also watching the exchange between Ranma and Shampoo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once she noticed that Ranma noticed this she started working on something else.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma-Chan glanced over to the chair on the left side of the captain's chair. This is where Raye would sit. If she ever came back to the bridge, that is. Ranma had requested that she be assigned an assistant so at least they would sit there, but the seat remained empty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma-Chan chuckled when she looked over to Mina's station. She was sulking while staring directly at her station. She moved her glance over to Ryouga's station. Ryouga had his eyes affixed straight ahead and appeared to be very embarrassed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma-Chan had turned to walk back into her ready room when Lita called off to her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, Commander?\" Ranma-Chan replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"There's an incoming message for you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"In here, please,\" Ranma-Chan asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita acknowledged and the computer on Ranma's desk started to chirp. Ranma-Chan walked over and had a seat. She punched a button and Genma in his admiral's uniform appeared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hey, pop.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hello boy,\" Genma cocked his head. \"Why are you a girl?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Got splashed,\" Ranma-Chan explained.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why don't you change back?\" Genma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Been busy. Working and all. What have you been doing?\" Ranma asked smugly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma started to scream. \"YOU LITTLE INGRATE! AND HERE I GIVE YOU ALL THE BEST MISSIONS!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I've had 32 crew members killed in three months and you refer to that as the best missions?\" Ranma dryly retorted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma calmed down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Look, here is why I called you. We got an incoming message this morning.\" Genma hit a few buttons and Tatewaki Kuno appeared on the screen. He began to speak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I, the blue thunder of the Alpha Quadrant, Tatewaki Kuno, Age 17, hereby warn you, the Federation. If you do not turn over Ranma Saotome to me for punishment in ten days I shall come to Earth and unleash the fury of my new weapon on you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly Kodachi popped into the shot. \"That retched pig-tailed girl and Akane Tendo must also be turned over for punishment!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno and his sister began to fight.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The pig-tailed girl shall not be harmed!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Then neither will my darling Ranma!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane Tendo is mine to love!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She must die!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma groaned. \"Pop?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma reappeared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So what do you want?\" Ranma-Chan asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You are ordered to turn yourself over to him.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma fell out of her chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What are you nuts?\" She screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma cleared his throat. He then turned to the side. \"I told you he wouldn't go for that.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly a bucket of water comes splashing on Genma and he becomes a panda. He is then promptly kicked out of the shot by Happosai.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RANMA!\" Happosai bellowed. \"Turn yourself over, kill him, whatever! Just keep him from using that new weapon of his on my collection!\" Happosai cleared his throat. \"I mean Earth.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay, okay.\" Ranma-Chan rolled her eyes and grumbled. \"Do you know where the transmission came from?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"OF COURSE NOT!\" Happosai bellowed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma-Panda leaned into the shot with a sign. \"Somewhere in the Zima-Prime system.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay.\" Ranma nodded. \"We'll take care of it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The transmission ended. Ranma stood and walked out onto the bridge. Shampoo stood and moved into her seat. Ranma looked to Lita.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Everything in working order?\" She asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am &ndash; err &ndash; sir &ndash; err\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook her head. \"Thank you. Commander Aino, e.t.a. to the Zima Prime system at warp six?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina typed in some calculations. \"Four days.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good. Ensign Hibiki, set a course.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh-huh,\" Ryouga mumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked to Shampoo and smiled. Shampoo just looked at the viewscreen. Ranma sighed and walked towards the turbo lift. The ship started to move but suddenly shook to a stop, sending people flying.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oops.\" Ryouga winced as Shampoo proceeded to kick the holy hell out of him.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff continued to pick up the stacks of PADDs and other items that were sent flying in the sudden stop. He had just gotten the office cleaned up from the first time, and then it happened again. He was starting to wonder if this was a mechanical issue or just operator error.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye was sitting at her desk typing on her computer. She had been at it for the past hour. The only pauses in her typing were when she would stop to either get another cup of coffee or swear at what she was writing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff wanted to ask her what was wrong but he could sense that she was very agitated. He knew that he was going to have to help her sort things out, but he also knew that this was not the right time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"God damn it!\" Raye said, hitting the delete button on her computer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander?\" Jeff asked. Raye turned to him. \"Is that something that I could help you with? After all, I am your assistant.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye shook her head. \"No, it's personal.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff nodded in understanding. He went into the other room to clean up in there.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye sighed and tried to clear her mind so that she could think. She used to have no problem keeping her mind clear and focused, but not anymore.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's been quite some time since Raye meditated. Most of the time she just didn't feel like it. Other times she just felt too sad to be able to.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye hated life right now.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She hadn't really spoken to Serena, Mina, or Lita since Lita's wedding. She made the mistake of getting drunk. That was the last thing that she needed - a depressant.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye sighed and began typing again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">To Admiral Genma Saotome, Starfleet Command. It is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation&hellip;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Damn it. Why is this so hard to write?\" Raye mumbled to herself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff walked back into the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Maybe it's because you don't want to write it?\" He pondered, as he threw some items into the trash disposal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mind your business, Lt.\" Raye scowled. \"And stop reading my mind.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Begging your pardon, Commander, but you are my business,\" Jeff stated quite matter-of-factly. \"I am YOUR assistant. Not just a janitor.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye sighed. \"Look. It's a long story that I have NO interest in getting into.\" Raye thought back for a moment. \"Not only that, I'm not ALLOWED to get into it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay then,\" Jeff said, walking off, knowing that she would be changing her mind eventually.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye turned back to the computer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"By the way&hellip;\" Jeff called. \"Do you want to keep this? It was in the trash can but it looks important.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff walked over and set Raye's nameplate on her desk. The nameplate that Darien gave her. The nameplate with the rose on it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye looked at it, looked at Jeff, and then looked at the floor. Raye began to cry. Jeff looked around uncomfortably. He took the nameplate and tossed it back to where it was. He sat in the chair directly across from Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I can help you.\" He stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye looked up, her eyes filled with tears.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It started ten years ago&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stepped out of the shower. He was all male again. He loved being the captain because he could get a water shower installed in his quarters. No sucker sonic showers for him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked out and put his uniform back on. He smiled when he saw Akane sitting on his bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What a waste of time. You're just going to have to take it off again.\" Akane grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma grinned back at her and pounced.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma rubbed his hands up and down his wife as they kissed passionately. Ranma started to unzip his uniform shirt, as did Akane when it happened.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lt;Nifty Star Trek Doorbell Sound Here!&gt;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Son of a bitch!\" Ranma growled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked to the door as he re-zipped his shirt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Who is it?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma started to flail his arms at Akane who took the hint. Akane ran a few laps around the room, looking for a place to hide. Finally, she just dropped and rolled underneath the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma regained his composure and opened the door.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Howdy,\" Ranma said to his rival.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hi.\" Ryouga walked in and hopped onto Ranma's bed. The bed bounced down low enough to hit Akane slightly. She managed to hold in a yelp. Ranma grimaced at the thought of Akane being squished.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked over to his desk and grabbed his chair and sat in it, facing Ryouga.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's going on, Ryouga,\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Let me get this out of the way first,\" Ryouga said, standing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay&hellip;\" Ranma said, not knowing what to expect.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Permission to speak freely, Captain?\" Ryouga requested.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"Yeah, sure.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga hopped back onto the bed, once again squashing Akane. Ranma once again grimaced at the thought of his wife being smashed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, I know you know about my getting lost on the ship&hellip;\" Ryouga blushed. \"&hellip;Naked.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. If he spoke he'd start laughing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, that happened after I spent the night with Commander Aino. She thinks that she might be pregnant. But she refuses to go into sickbay to get tested.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She thinks it would be embarrassing for people to know that she slept with a subordinate.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head. \"It's not. But I don't understand what that has to do with me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga blushed again. \"I was wondering if you could kind of order her to go in there for a medical exam or something.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma thought about this for a moment. \"Sure, I guess.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga smiled, but then blushed again. \"Also, could you make sure that Akane isn't there at the time? I don't want her knowing what I did.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Still interested in her, huh?\" Ranma snickered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga smiled. \"That's right, Ranma. We had lunch together last week.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma raised an eyebrow. \"You had lunch together?\" Ranma walks over to his bed and hops onto it next to Ryouga. A small squeak is heard. \"Well good luck, buddy boy. And I will take care of Mina for you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga nods thanks to Ranma and walks out of his quarters. Ranma stands and looks under the bed. He sees Akane smiling.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lunch?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You were busy!\" Akane explains. \"Besides, you had lunch with Shampoo the other day.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma laughs. \"It doesn't count when you are there, along with the rest of the senior staff! It's not my fault they are all girls!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane crawls out from under the bed and stands next to Ranma. \"Now, where were we.\" Akane starts to put her arms around Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sighs. \"Speaking of Shampoo&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane pulls her arms away quickly. \"Way to kill the mood,\" Akane states, sitting on the bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She knows.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane stares at Ranma. \"HOW?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She saw it in your file.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane sighs. \"She mad?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No,\" Ranma states. \"She's upset though. Not really at the fact that we got married, but at the fact that we didn't tell her.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She would have gone ballistic,\" Akane exclaims.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shrugs. \"Maybe we should tell everyone else.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane shakes her head. \"Let's let Ryouga get over this thing he's involved in first. Who knows? Maybe he and Mina will get married and then I will be all yours with no one chasing me!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shifts uncomfortably.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma chuckles nervously. \"The Kunos are coming.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Son of a bitch.\" Akane swears.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "old-friends", "story": 4}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 22, "fields": {"chapter_number": 3, "title": "Insanity", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I SHALL SMITE THEE!\" Tatewaki Kuno exclaimed in his state of sleep slash regeneration.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The hallway leading to Kuno's regeneration chamber was dark, with the only light being the green pulsing lights of the other regeneration chambers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It had been three months but the Kuno's had finally managed to rebuild their cube, the first having been blown to bits by Ranma. The new cube was ready for the quantum torpedoes that had done them in the first time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Kuno's had looted a tritanium mine somewhere in the Beta Quadrant. Tritanium being the only material in the galaxy that could withstand the yield from a quantum torpedo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cube had to have several layers of the material if they were going to stand a chance against the Sisko's seven torpedo launchers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Kunos were ready this time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They also had a new weapon. They had bought it on the black market from the planet of North Korea. It appears that North Korea had secretly built isolytic weapons. They of course blamed the aggressive defense policy of the Federation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I SHALL DATE WITH YOU!\" Kuno screamed, his arms flying out of the restraints that held him upright. He grabbed a hold of something and pulled it close.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"LET GO OF ME!\" George Kuno, the Kuno's adopted brother screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno did not comply. George started screaming as Kuno began to lay sleep-kisses on him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"ARGH!\" He screamed ala Lucy in Charlie Brown after being kissed by Snoopy. George struggled best he could but still could not get out of the bear hug Tatewaki had him in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">At about this time Kodachi walked into the room. She noticed her brother embracing George. She scoffed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I see you two are getting along better.\" She stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George simply glared at her. \"Help me!\" He demanded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi nods and walks over to the pair. She walks up to Kuno. She leans close to his head and starts to whisper in his ear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's me, Akane.\" She whispered. \"Squeeze me harder!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno complied and George began to change colors. Kodachi laughed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"BITCH!\" George screamed at her in agony.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi laughed some more. \"Bitch, eh?\" She leaned back into her brother. \"I'm naked as well.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George's eyes went bug-eyed as one of Kuno's hands moved down George's back and grabbed his butt. He then started to scream again when he felt what he felt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Something poking at him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah, that.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"KODACHI!\" George screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi just laughed as she fluttered out of the room, black rose petals flying.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George knew that he had to act fast. It was only a matter of time before Kuno, who even though he was dead asleep; grinning intently now, moved in for the proverbial kill. That was another memory that he had no interest in having. He already had enough that were stuck in him by his two lustful siblings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ah-ha!\" George grinned as Kuno caressed him. George suddenly remembered that the Kunos were a collective. All of their minds were linked. All George had to do was make Kuno think of something that would cause him to release his grip.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George thought. What does Kuno hate more than anything?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George grinned again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inside Kuno's Mind:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma walked up to where Kuno was making out with a naked Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hello.\" Ranma said to Kuno.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"BE GONE!\" Kuno yelled at Saotome, holding Akane even tighter against him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma grinned. \"I didn't know you swung that way!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What speak you?\" Kuno asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma pointed at Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno looked. Now in the place of Akane was Rodney Dangerfield. He had Akane's hairstyle though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hey! Why'd you stop?\" Rodney/Akane asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"GOOD LORD!\" Kuno screamed as he pushed the Akane wannabe away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Reality:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The still sleeping Kuno pushed George away from him. George fell to the ground. He promptly grabbed Kuno's bokken, got into his best Sammy Sosa with a corked bat batting stance and &ndash;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">WHAP!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bokken connected with Kuno's face and smashed into a million pieces. Kuno snaps out of his regeneration cycle. He looks to George.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you the one who has awoken the great Tatewaki Kuno, the blue thunder of the Alpha Quadrant, out of his slumber?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George nodded. Kuno runs over and hugs his brother.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"THANK YOU!\" Kuno bubbles. George whimpers. Kuno then releases his brother.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I had the worst dream.\" Kuno sniffles. George pats his brother on the shoulder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's okay. Let the thoughts drop out of your mind and think happy thoughts.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Happy thoughts?\" Kuno asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George nods. \"Like the thought of us killing that retched Ranma Saotome, and avenging father's death.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno grinned. \"I like the whole idea of killing that retched Ranma Saotome, but as for our dear father, well he's not dead.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George just stared at him. \"You told me he was dead!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno smiled and started to back away. \"About that&hellip;\" Kuno chuckles and runs away. George just sighs and starts to walk back to the control center of the ship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oh, kiekie! George heard in his mind. He looks up, and around, and passes it off as just a silly prank that Kuno was playing on him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George! The voice said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Cut it out, Taki. I'm not in the mood.\" George grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly a holographic image of Principal Kuno appeared before him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"JESUS!\" George screamed, hopping backward a good twenty feet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, no.\" The holograph chuckled. \"It's just me, your daddy!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George eyed the holograph for a moment and then resumed his work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where did you go?\" George asked it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You see, I had to hide out for a while.

So what do you want?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The holograph walked over to George.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I heard that when you thought I was dead that you wanted to avenge my death! This clinched it that you were my favorite kiekie.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George looked back to the holo-daddy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You mean that there was some confusion before?\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, you know that you are the best, but the others are my biological kids, so it was kind of a draw.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George smiled. \"So, what do I win?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You win the secret to Silver Millennium torpedoes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell are those?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They pack twice the yield that quantum torpedoes do!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George grinned even more. \"So it will be easy to defeat the Sisko?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The holograph nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well then,\" George stated. \"Let's have it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The holograph began to upload data into George's mind. George smiled with every gigabyte of destructive goodness.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor slowly opened his eyes as he woke up. The view he had didn't reveal much more than the ceiling of his jail cell. Trevor didn't mind though. At least the ghost he saw wasn't above him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor?\" A voice said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ghostly figure looked over Trevor. Trevor closed his eyes and started to chant to himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am not insane. I am not insane.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, you're not.\" The figure replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor sat up and looked at him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What are you?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"My name is Foster.\" He said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You mean like the beer?\" Trevor asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster nodded. \"Yes. I knew that was your favorite beer so that is what I named myself.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You just named yourself? And how did you know that was my favorite beer? You're not stereotyping me just because I am Australian are you?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster shook his head. \"No, Trevor. I know all about you. I have been with you for the past two years.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Trevor asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'll explain,\" Foster stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">INTERACTIVE FLASHBACK:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor, dressed in his Starfleet uniform, is hiding behind some rocks. There is phaser fire zipping over his head. Next to him are two other Starfleet officers. Trevor bears the rank of Lt. Junior Grade. The other two are ensigns. They peak their heads up just enough to fire off a couple of shots but then duck down again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You see,\" Foster states. \"This is Tenlix Three. A planet on the Cardassian/Federation border. This is my home.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Unfortunately no one knew that when the Federation set up a supply depot there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Wait, Foster.\" Real-time Trevor states. \"We scanned the planet and there were no life forms.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Our people are energy beings. We would show up on your scanners as simple electrostatic pockets.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some more phaser fire goes over their heads and several small explosions happen right behind them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You see, those energy pockets exploding from the Dominion weapons are actually my people being killed.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I didn't kill any, did I?\" Real Trevor asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, the Federation's phasers passed right through us. The Dominion's though. They were on just the right frequency to affect us.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WE NEED TO RETREAT!\" One of the ensigns screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"NO!\" Trevor stated rather bluntly. \"We are not leaving this position. We cannot let them advance any further.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor stood and opened up on the advancing Dominion troops. After a while, all the enemy troops were either killed or retreating.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">REAL-TIME:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I still don't understand,\" Trevor said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor, if you hadn't held your position the Dominion troops would have advanced on us and eventually killed us all.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor sighed and looked at the floor. \"We didn't know you were there. To be fair and honest we were protecting the food rations.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster laughed. \"Yes, but on purpose or not you saved a civilization of thousands of beings just like me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor smiled. He had no idea he had such an effect on anyone in that blasted war. As far as he knew all he was good for was killing Jem Hadar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So.\" Foster continued. \"I have been following you around for the past three years in order to repay you for what you did.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor laughed. \"You could have fixed my ship! Then we would be even.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster sighed. \"Unfortunately I can't fix mechanical things. I can manipulate space and gravity and walk through walls but I can't fix a simple thing like your Runabout.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Did you say walk through walls?\" Trevor asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Can you walk through that wall, find a key and get me out of here?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster again nodded. \"But that won't be enough to repay my debt to you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor shrugged. \"It'll be a good start.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster nodded once more and walked out through the jail cell door. He wandered around the police station for a bit before he finally found a set of keys on a desk. He brought the keys back and showed them to Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Which one do you think it is?\" Foster asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor picked the one which looked most like what a jail cell key should look like and tried it out. It worked and the cell opened up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay. Now, become invisible again.\" Trevor instructed Foster.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"But I want to see things like you do. I kind of like having this form.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor groaned. \"Well, at least make yourself whole. I can see right through you! And you will have to change your clothes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster nodded, began to glow, and became fully visible. He then looked at a magazine that was lying on one of the police officers' desks and made himself up so he was wearing the clothes that the man on the cover was wearing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Very stylish!\" Trevor noted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thank you!\" Foster gleamed as the pair walked out of the vacant police station and into the darkening streets.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Captain's Log: Stardate 60147.2.

She came and sat down across from Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga said you wanted to see me?\" She asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma silently cursed Ryouga's name. \"Yeah, uh.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned to his replicator. \"Would you like something to drink?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shifted in her seat a bit. She didn't know that this was going to be something that would take so long that Ranma would offer her a drink.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Just some water will be fine, thank you, Captain,\" Mina replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"One water and one tea; Earl Grey, hot.\" He instructed the computer. The replicator complied and the beverages appeared. He handed Mina her glass and took a sip out of his.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So,\" Ranma said. \"You know that we have been on this ship for almost four months now and we haven't really gotten to know each other?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded. \"We didn't really get off to that great of a start.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma laughed. He rubbed his head in the memory of Mina smashing a bottle over it. \"All that trouble and I wasn't even a Changling!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina giggled. Ranma leaned back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So, tell me about yourself. What do you like to do? What kind of sports do you like? Where do you want to go after here?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina also leaned back in the seat. \"Well, I spend a lot of my time off duty with Commander Tskuino and Commander Kino.\" She just couldn't get herself to say 'Commander Gosnell'. \"And I used to with Commander Hino, but she's kept to herself lately.\" Ranma nodded as he listened.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I enjoy volleyball. I play on the holodeck whenever I can.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma takes a sip of his tea. \"Akane plays volleyball as well. You two should play together sometime.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nods. \"As for after here, well I haven't really thought that far ahead. I was happy on the starbase that I was assigned to before my transfer, but I am enjoying it out here. When we're not being shot at, that is.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nods in agreement to that.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, here is the reason I wanted to see you.\" Ranma began his lie. \"Apparently your physical was accidentally deleted and sickbay needs you to come and take another one.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded, not believing a word of what Ranma just told her. \"Okay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pair just sat in silence for a moment. Mina finally decided to break the silence.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Did Ryouga ask you to have me take the physical?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma spit his tea all over his console and started flailing his arms wildly. Ranma was a terrible liar. \"What? No.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina watched Ranma attempt to clean up the tea for a minute. Ranma saw her eyeing him and knew it was useless to continue with his charade. \"Well, yes, but don't tell him I told you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sighed. \"So you know what I did?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So, do you think that I am a horrible officer for doing such a thing with a subordinate?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma sat up and looked right at Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina took little comfort in that.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Look, Commander.\" Ranma started. \"Ryouga isn't a bad guy-\" Mina cut him off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He took advantage of me when I was drunk!\" Mina exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma just looked at her some more. \"I don't think that was the case. You have more self-control than that. This I do know. I have read your record.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now, I am going to be perfectly frank with you. This is just as much your fault as it is his. You two need to work it out before it affects your work any more than it already has.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded. She knew that he was right but she didn't want to admit that she could have been so sloppy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you think I am a bad officer because I am sleeping with Commander Tendo?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No,\" Mina replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why not? She's subordinate.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You're married.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shrugged. \"What if we weren't?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina looked shyly at Ranma. \"No.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked at Mina for an explanation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You're a good officer and you wouldn't let it affect your decisions,\" Mina added.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma smiled. \"You are a good officer too, Mina. And so is Ryouga. He may be a moron, but he's a good officer and a good guy. Don't let something silly like this get in the way of something good that might happen.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded and stood. Ranma stood as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Please go get that checked,\" Ranma asked. \"For not only yours and Ryouga's piece of mind, but mine as well.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded, turned, and walked out the door. After the door closed Ranma let out an exasperated sigh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"God that was the most uncomfortable talk I had ever had to have,\" Ranma said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Did you have to tell her we were sleeping together?\" Akane asked from the adjoining room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We're married. I think it's implied.\" Ranma stated as Akane walked up and sat on Ranma's couch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stood and walked around his desk. He sat down next to Akane and gave her a kiss. Akane grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How'd she find out anyway?\" Akane asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lita told her. She and Serena and Raye all know.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I can't wait till we can tell everyone.\" Akane grinned as she kissed Ranma again.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff sat up as Raye finished her story of events that had taken place over the last ten years. Jeff took in the words and processed the events in his head. The phone call letting Raye know that Darien had died. The shock of Raye's best friend shooting her. The bolt from the blue of seeing her dead husband on the Sisko's main viewer. The anguish of having to shoot her husband dead.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff felt a tear come to his eye. He had dealt with many types of pain over the years, but never anything this intense.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff realized that if he was going to help Raye through this he was going to have to pull himself together and say something.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye had just finished with her story. Her face was red and puffy from crying through all of it. She simply stared off at the wall past Jeff.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander.\" Jeff finally stated. Raye looked over to him, on the verge of tears once again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The pain I feel from you is unbelievable.\" He continued. \"I cannot make it go away, but I can help you make it more bearable.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye stood. \"MORE BEARABLE?\" She screamed. \"What the fuck do you mean 'more bearable'?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"As someone once told me, pain is simply weakness leaving the body.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you saying I am weak?\" Raye growled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, yes,\" Jeff stated rather bluntly. Raye dropped back into her seat. \"But it's nothing to be ashamed of. We are all weak in some ways. Myself, if I see a kitten I start to blubber like a baby.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye laughed. Jeff blushed and continued.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"But what makes us strong is how we handle our weaknesses.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nodded. \"I guess that I am not handling this very well at all.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff shook his head. \"How long did it take you to come to terms with Darien's original 'death'?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye shook her head. \"I didn't.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This is why your pain is having such an effect on you now. I can tell that your mind is very strong and that you can overcome this. It's going to take a while and daily meditation sessions.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye shook her head again. \"I have tried meditating. All I can see is me pulling the trigger and the look on Darien's face.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff nodded. \"And then you wake up. See, your mind is trying to deal with it, but your heart isn't letting you. I have several different techniques that will help you ignore what your heart is&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">saying.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ignore my heart?\" Raye asked, thoroughly confused.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff nodded. \"Your heart and mind need to work together. But right now they aren't. Together we can get them back on the same page and get you back to the way you were before.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I doubt that,\" Raye said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff stood up and gestured for Raye to follow him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where are we going?\" She asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"My quarters,\" Jeff explained. \"The sooner we get started the sooner you will be back to one hundred percent operating capacity.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye laughed. She was beginning to like Jeff. No one had been able to make her laugh in quite a while. She liked it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh.\" Jeff started, stopping just shy of the door. \"Go to your quarters first and change into something more comfortable.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye became rather defensive at this moment. \"What?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff realized what she was thinking and quickly put her at ease. \"Don't worry, Commander. I don't like girls.\" He smiled. Raye understood, having spent four years in San Francisco. \"You need to be in a very comfortable state. Normally on Betazed, we do these meditations naked, but I know that would make you far more uncomfortable than it would help you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nodded. \"Is there anything you people don't do naked?\" Raye asked, referring to the Betazoid wedding ritual of being married in the nude.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff didn't miss a beat. \"Cooking bacon and playing with scissors.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye laughed as she walked out the door, down the hall, and into the turbolift to go and change.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Crossroads dropped out of warp at the edge of the Zima Prime system. She continued to cruise at one-half impulse towards the third planet from the Zima Prime sun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami was seated in her captain's chair.

She hadn't yet gotten a chance to make first contact with a new civilization.

If she had wanted to stay on Earth she would have just become a regular doctor in Tokyo and that would be that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">No, Ami needed to be out there in the vastness of space.

That doesn't sound very interesting at all.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It is interesting.\" The recruiter informed her. \"They are a very important part of Starfleet. They represent the Federation in conflict resolution, treaty negotiations, and first contact.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"First contact?\" Ami asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes.

To let them know about us; who we are, where we are from, and our goals.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami grinned. She thought that could be a lot of fun.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami turned to the man. \"So, how long do you have to be in the academy for that?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"There are three years of classroom and then two years on a ship as an ensign. Once you complete that you are promoted past Lt. and right to Lt. Commander. Nice little loophole there. The Federation Charter forbids any Starfleet officer below the rank of Lt.

Once that happens you are then placed on a diplomatic ship and off you go.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's also a quick way to make Captain because we don't have enough officers specifically trained for diplomacy.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami smiled again. \"Where do I sign?\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The chirping of Vong's computer brought Ami back to reality. She turned her head slightly to hear what he was about to say.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Scans of the planet show no signs of warp capability,\" Vong stated very glumly. Ami sighed as did the rest of the bridge crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Very well, do a thorough scan of the planet for the records, and then let's get out of here.\" Ami groaned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am,\" Vong replied. \"They do have spaceflight though and tracking satellites in orbit above the planet. I would recommend taking a position two million kilometers away and in the shadow of the first moon to avoid detection.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami nodded. \"Helm, make it so.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman nodded and the ship took a position in the shadow of the moon closest to the planet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am showing signs of a base on this moon, but no life forms,\" Vong noted. \"But the base is on the other side so even if there are tracking devices there they should not be able to spot us.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good,\" Ami replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is what life was like for the blue-haired girl anymore. Finding new worlds with people on them, but not warp-capable though. The prime directive forbids them from making contact with such worlds. Sometimes though, Ami would like to just beam down there. Just to see what would happen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She knew it would be a mess though. She had two classes spanning four semesters on why there is a prime directive and what the consequences would be if the prime directive is breached.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the words of one of her professors, it'd be a 'fucking mess'.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was the last thing she wanted to do. Have to clean up a mess.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The tactical panel began to chirp at almost the same time as the operations panel. Both Vong and the tactical officer consulted each other before Vong addressed the captain.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain, we are receiving a distress call from the planet's surface.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami turned to Ark who turned to his display.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Federation?\" Ark asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vong nodded his confirmation. \"Yeah, I am receiving an audio transmission with it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"On speaker,\" Ami ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The shock of hearing the voice on the speaker caused Ami to almost fall out of her seat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"To any ship receiving this message.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was Ami.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But it wasn't Ami.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami looked at Ark.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What are you doing on that planet?\" Ark dryly jokes. Ami simply smacked him in the head. The recording continued its plea.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This is the Federation starship the U.S.S. Sydney. We are a Runabout class scout ship. We suffered engine failure and were forced to crash land in a wooded area at 44 degrees, 17 minutes west latitude; 17 degrees, 5 minutes north longitude. If you can assist us, please signal.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The message began to repeat. Vong shut it off and looked to his boos for orders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Can the civilization detect the signal?\" Ami asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vong checked his display. \"They might eventually track down the power surge coming from the transmission, but there will be no way that they can decode the transmission.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And if we replied?\" Ark asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, they won't be able to trace it,\" Vong answered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Open a channel then,\" Ami stated, standing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Audio only, ma'am,\" Vong informed her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That's fine.\" Ami sat back down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A bleep is heard and Vong acknowledges that the channel is open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"U.S.S. Sydney, this is the U.S.S. Crossroads,\" Ami stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ami!\" The computer voice replied. \"It's wonderful to finally meet you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami shifted uncomfortably. She had never had a conversation with herself before and she wasn't sure that she liked it a lot.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, about that,\" Ami said. \"Why do you sound like me?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, Trevor reprogrammed my audio subroutine to sound like you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"TREVOR?\" Ami screamed. The entire bridge crew looked in her direction. She motioned to Vong to mute the transmission.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Send it to my ready room.\" She ordered. Vong did as he was told and Ami scurried off into her office.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are we there yet?\" Foster asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor turned to his companion and simply glared at him. Foster took the hint and shut up. Not for long though.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So, who is Ami?\" Foster asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor turned and glared at him again, but stopped and let out an exasperated sigh. He looked at the restaurant that they had stopped in front of. Trevor motioned for it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You hungry?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster just shook his head. \"No, but that's okay because I am never hungry. If you are though I will eat with you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor nodded and the pair walked into the restaurant. A waiter sat them at a table. Trevor starts to look over the menu.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shit I can't read this.\" He states grumbling at the alien language the menu is in. Trevor sighs and when the waitress walks up he simply points to a picture that looks good. He then orders a tea. Foster orders a tea as well and the waitress walks off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So?\" Asks Foster.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ami is a girl I knew for a while. Till before the war when we had to go our different ways.\" Trevor said sipping the tea the waitress brought back for him. Foster tried to sip the tea but realized he&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">didn't like it one bit.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why didn't you keep in contact?\" Foster asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She was sent on a deep space first contact assignment and I was sent off to fight in that bloody war,\" Trevor stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor's food came. It was a pasta-like dish that had what appeared to be crab, shrimp, and some other kind of seafood in it. Foster just looked at it in disgust, but Trevor smiled and took a bite.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh, my good damn,\" Trevor exclaimed. \"This is delicious.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster looked at it. \"May I?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor nodded as he dug in. Foster picked up a fork and took a small piece. He ate it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Not bad.\" Foster acknowledged. Trevor offered him another bite but he declines. Trevor shrugs and continues eating.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Did you love her?\" Foster asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"MUMF?\" Trevor asks with his mouth full. Foster laughs at him. Trevor quickly swallows.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Love?\" Trevor asks again, this time understandable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah. Did you love her?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor blushes and nods. \"Yeah, I did.\" Trevor sighs. \"I still do.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well then.\" Foster grins. \"That is how I will repay my debt to you. I will help you find Ami.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor laughed. \"Good luck! She could be anywhere in the galaxy!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster nodded. \"That's okay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor laughs again as he finishes eating, leaves what should be enough money on the table, and walks out with Foster right behind him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why are you laughing?\" Foster asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor never stops walking, nor looks at his companion. \"Well for one, you may be able to zip around the galaxy in mere moments, but I cannot. And for two, Ami is a beautiful, sexy, yummy little thing who has no doubtedly found herself a new man and forgotten all about stupid old me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster sighed and continued to walk with Trevor in silence. Even if Trevor was going to give up on his one true love, Foster wasn't.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "insanity", "story": 4}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 23, "fields": {"chapter_number": 4, "title": "Waiting", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Night, or what could best be described as night, had fallen on the USS Sisko as she warped towards her destination. The hallway lights throughout the ship were dimmed to fifty percent. The nonessential sections of the ship were empty. Ten-Forward was closed for business, all but the required track lighting turned off. A few people had still come in to watch the stars before heading to bed, but they were dwindling fast.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though the Sisko was a battleship, and was ready for anything twenty-four hours a day, the place seemed vacant. There were a couple of people manning the stations in torpedo control. There was one security officer working in the security office. Those seemed to be the only places on the ship where the lights were too full illumination. Even engineering turned down the lights at night to give one a sense of night and day.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Walking down the hallways there was no one. Occasionally a pair of security officers came down a corridor on their rounds, but other than that everyone was in bed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well, not everyone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the bridge the lights were also turned down to one-half illumination, the majority of the light in the room coming off of the control panels.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The third watch helmsman leaned back in his seat. There really wasn't anything for him to do. The navigational system automatically corrected the course when necessary. He let out a yawn as he turned to look at the third watch operations officer. He also didn't have much to do. He occasionally looked at his panel to make sure everything was okay, but if anything bad happened, or was about to happen, alerts would sound.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The third watch tactical officer was the only one who seemed to be paying much attention to his control panel. They were at an elevated tactical alert status, so he had to be watching for any ships that may attempt to intercept the Sisko.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both chairs to either side of the captain's seat were vacant. There was no need for a first officer or a command support officer on third watch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the other stations situated on various parts of the bridge were also vacant and deactivated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There was also very little noise on the bridge. The only sounds that could be heard were the blowing of the life support system, the hum of the artificial gravity plating, an occasional chirp from the helm control, and the soft, gentle groan of the warp engines. There was no talking though. With only four officers, no one really felt the need to chat with each other. If they did they usually used the instant messaging capabilities programmed into each terminal. They could just as easily talk to each other out loud, but the dimness of the bridge silently asked them to be quiet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the captain's chair sat Mina. She was leaning back in it as much as she could to try and keep herself comfortable. She had her legs crossed, right over left.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina didn't usually work third watch. However, that night, Lt. Girard, the third watch commander, wasn't feeling well and asked her to work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was fine with her. She was enjoying the peace and quiet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was until she started to think to herself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She started thinking about what the captain had said to her. She was thinking about what she had done to Ryouga the day after. She was thinking about what would happen if she was pregnant. She had planned to go to sickbay earlier that day but didn't. She blamed it on being busy but looking at her six-sentence activity report she knew that was a lie.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina's big blue eyes shifted direction. They moved up the view screen to the chronometer right above it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:17:13 it read.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She watched it a bit more.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:17:14</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:17:15</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:17:16</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don't let something silly like this get in the way of something good that might happen. Mina readjusted her gaze to the stars.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What the hell did he mean by that? She pondered. She couldn't imagine that Ranma was trying to hook her up with Ryouga. Why would he want to help out Ryouga like that? The two of them were always arguing. The only thing that kept it from actually becoming fisticuffs was the fact that Ranma is Ryouga's C.O. And even Ryouga had to have some respect for the rank.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shifted her eyes upwards again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:18:55</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:18:56</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:18:57</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina began to ponder the idea of a relationship between herself and Ryouga. Ranma was right about one thing. Ryouga seemed like a really nice guy. He had been comforting her in her self-pity state that she had been in right after Lita's wedding. He had complimented her and told her she was a total babe.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As inappropriate as it was to tell your boss that, she appreciated it. He seemed genuinely concerned about her feelings, and she could not see any devious scheme that he was hatching at the time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I guess I did want it as much as he did. Mina thought. But do I actually want a relationship with him?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina glanced at the digital timepiece once again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:20:02</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:20:03</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:20:04</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga was a moron though, and that thought bounced around in Mina's head like one of those super high bouncing balls. He was constantly getting lost on the ship. He had gotten them lost while manually steering the ship through a nebula patch. He was unable to make simple turns, starts, or stops without sending the crew of the ship to the deck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga drank a lot as well. He would spend several hours after his shift sitting in ten-forward going through glass after glass of peach Schnapps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, I'd drink a lot too if I had his problems. Mina thought to herself, of course referring to the little black piglet that he turns into upon contact with cold water.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina checked out her companion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:22:17</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:22:18</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:22:19</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina had learned a lot about Ryouga over the past few days. She had sat down and talked to Lita, who talks to Gosnell, who talks to the Captain. Granted that would make what she learned hearsay hearsay, but it would have to work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina knew that Ryouga had a crush on Commander Tendo. She didn't understand why Ranma and Akane didn't just end his little crush by announcing their marriage publicly, but she assumed they had their reasons.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina had also learned of Ryouga's curse. Both from her source and from seeing it first hand when the bridge's sprinkler system went off a few months ago. She found it interesting. She knew the curse would have to be a factor in any decision that she would make.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But there was an easy answer to the curse. They could just fly back to Earth and have Ryouga jump into the spring of drowned man. Why no one had thought of that yet was beyond her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do I really want to be stuck in a relationship? Mina asked herself silently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:24:44</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:24:45</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:24:46</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was obvious that she didn't. If she had she wouldn't have used the word 'stuck' to refer to the situation. Mina knew that this job was a relationship killer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She had kept in contact with Ami prior to the war. She had learned that Ami had met a great man. A man she had planned to marry and spend the rest of her life with.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then the orders came in. The orders sending the two of them their separate ways. Neither of them really had the change to explore all the possibilities. Both of their futures had been determined by some no-name admiral in a cold grey building who didn't even deliver the PADD himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Could I handle that? If he and I fell in love and planned to get married? Could I handle receiving that PADD that sends us in different directions?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:26:30</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:26:31</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">60150.2 02:26:32</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Does this night ever freakin' end?\" Mina stated out loud.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The three other officers on the bridge all turned in unison and stared at Mina for a bit. Mina, realizing she had just broken some weird third watch silence rule, meekly adjusted in her seat so that she was looking in a different direction than the others.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami was thinking nearly in unison with Mina all those light-years away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was a name that Ami never thought she would hear again in her life. She had thought that he had gotten killed in the Dominion Wars like so many others.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then, here of all places, she gets a distress call from a computer sounding just like her. The computer tells her that her 'should have been' fianc&eacute;e was on some pre-warp planet. Stranded and in jail no less.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The name kept ringing in her ears. It was keeping her from getting to sleep. Ami kept readjusting herself in her bed but the moment she got comfortable she heard it again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clear as day it echoed in her head; in the perfect computer facsimile of her voice.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>About Eight Hours Ago:</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami slides into her seat behind the large oak and glass desk that sits in front of the window overlooking the starboard side of the USS Crossroads.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She pulls up her computer and hits some buttons. The Federation logo appears with some text below it flashing 'AUDIO ONLY'. She inhales deeply and starts to speak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Who are you?\" Ami asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am the computer on the U.S.S. Sydney.\" Computer Ami replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And who is Trevor?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor Watts. You know him.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami sighed and took in another breath. \"And explain to me again why you sound like me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer copied Ami's sigh and began to reply. \"After he was discharged from Starfleet he was given this Runabout. Trevor didn't have any friends left. All had been killed in battle.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor didn't want to go home. There was nothing for him there, he told me. So he decided that he was going to see if he could perchance find you out here somewhere. The problem was he didn't know which way you went.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So he decided that he would just roam around and if fate decided that you two should be together then he would find you. About a year ago Trevor gave up. He decided that he would just find somewhere to build a house and grow old. He couldn't bear to be without you though, so he used some old communications that you had sent him and programmed me to sound like you.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He also upgraded my AI circuits so that I wouldn't just be a computer, I could also be a friend.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami was speechless. She could do nothing but stare at her wall and take in what this computer had just informed her. She had missed Trevor as well. She had hoped that he would think about her and find her once he got out of the service.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hello?\" The computer Ami asked. Real Ami came back to reality and looked at her terminal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where is Trevor now?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Last I heard he was in jail. He had been arrested.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Ami screeched.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Don't worry, Ami.\" The computer replied. \"I've nearly gotten the transporters repaired. Once I do I will beam him out of jail and back to the Runabout.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nuts to that,\" Ami replied. \"We'll be in orbit in just a few minutes. We'll beam you to the cargo bay-\" Ami cut herself off when she realized she was talking to the Runabout's computer, and not to a real person.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We'll beam the Runabout to the cargo bay and also bring Trevor aboard.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ami, you know that you can't come in orbit around this planet.\" The Sydney's computer explained. \"This is a pre-warp culture, but they are very technologically advanced. They will detect a ship of your size and that would violate the prime directive.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The prime directive has already been breached. Trevor's made contact with these people.\" Ami stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, but they do not know that he is an alien. This race looks identical to humans. His universal translator is working fine and he told me that that did not give him a DNA test.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The local authorities have passed off our crash as a meteorite and I am securely hidden in a cave.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami realized that she could not argue with her proverbial self any longer. \"What do you want me to do then?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Just wait a while. The transporters should be fixed by nightfall. I will retrieve Trevor then and we will take off. We can then rendezvous with you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami sighed. \"Alright, fine. But if anything goes wrong, we're coming over there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer chirped what is best explained as a computer's way of saying okay. The transmission then ended and Ami is left to sit in her office and think about everything she just heard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Back to the present:</em></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The problem Ami was having is that the thinking she was doing didn't stop when she left her ready room. Ami stayed on the bridge until 00:45, six hours after her duty shift ended.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She sat in her chair that whole time waiting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing happened though. She had them hail the Runabout again only to be told that things were going slower than originally planned and that they should continue waiting.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami wasn't sure what she was worried about though. She wasn't even sure if she was actually worried. She could easily hop over to the planet, scoop Trevor and the Runabout up, and be gone before the people there even realized something had happened.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But she felt compelled to wait.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her diplomatic training and the lectures she was given about the prime directive kept coming back into her mind.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, Ami's mind was busy that night. It seemed the only thing her mind didn't want to do was shut down and go to sleep.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Computer, time?\" Ami asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The current time is zero two forty-seven hours.\" The computer replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami sighed and slid upright in her bed. She got up and went to her closest. She picked out one of her grey uniform undershirts and a pair of black shorts. She walked into her bathroom and grabbed a towel.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami walked back out, threw on a pair of running shoes, and left her quarters. She casually walked down the brightly lit hallways.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a ship as big as the Crossroads there was always something going on. None of the lights on this ship were dimmed. There were numerous people walking up and down the hallways, each acknowledging their captain as they walked past her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami walked on down to the turbo lift. After waiting a few moments the doors opened up and she stepped in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Deck eight.\" She ordered. The lift complied and took her down the six decks to deck eight. Ami walked down the hall to a corridor that was thinner than most of the others.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Along this corridor, there were no doors. Just every couple hundred meters there was another corridor that came to connect with it. Ami stood and looked down the corridor as a man, drenched with sweat came running past her. Ami drops her towel at the junction she walked up at and begins to jog.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Crossroads was one of the first ships to have a running track installed in it, rather than making crew members either use a treadmill or a holodeck. Ami preferred this to a treadmill or holodeck anyway. The distance all the way around the track was near three kilometers. It went all the way around the saucer section of the ship, and it was on the deck that had the largest circumference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami knew that in order to get back to where she started that she would have to keep going. She liked having something to work for and after the third lap or so she started to really have to work for it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami somehow ran twelve laps that night. When she returned to her quarters her mind didn't have anything to think about. Not a thing except sleep.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SNORT!\" Ranma snorted as he rolled a bit in his bed. The loud sound woke Akane up from one of her deepest sleeps. She glared at Ranma but the drool dripping from his wide-open mouth was just so cute that she didn't have the heart to wake him up and hit him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Computer, time,\" Akane whispered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Zero three thirty-six.\" The computer replied, not whispering.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane pointlessly tried shushing the computer. Ranma stirred a bit, but mumbled something about egg rolls and rolled over the other way. Akane grinned and slid out of bed. She walks over to her dresser and throws on a set of loose 'laundry day' clothes. She slowly walks back up to the bed, kisses Ranma on the forehead, and walks out of their quarters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane walked down the hallway, stopping a couple of times to look at the names on the door. She passed Raye's quarters. Then Serena's. Then Lita and Gosnell's. She finally came to the room she was looking for.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lt;Nifty Star Trek Doorbell here!&gt;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">No response.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane sighed and continued down the hallway.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She's usually up by now. She doesn't sleep all that much. Akane thought to herself as she arrived at the turbo lift. Akane hit the call button and waited patiently. The lift arrived and she stepped inside.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Deck eight.\" She ordered. The lift quickly took her down the four decks to deck eight. Once the doors opened she stepped out of the lift and began to walk towards the front of the ship. She nodded an acknowledgment to a pair of security officers on patrol.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane finally arrived at ten-forward. She walked in through the double doors and looked around. Behind the bar, she saw a man doing what could best be described as opening duties. She smiled when he saw her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good morning, Commander.\" He stated. Akane smiled back at him. \"We won't be serving anything for about twenty more minutes.\" He added.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That's okay,\" Akane said as she walked towards a table that was near the windows. There she saw who she was looking for.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I dropped by your quarters. I wanted to talk to you.\" Akane said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo just continued to look out the windows. Akane pulled out a chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"May I?\" She asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo nodded. Akane sat down. The pair sat in silence for a few moments.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What you need?\" Shampoo finally asked, not bothering to look in Akane's direction.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I just wanted to do the best I can in explaining why Ranma and I didn't tell you about us.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo didn't move. \"I listening.\" She stated. Akane cleared her throat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We got married in a spur of the moment thing. We were going to wait until we got done with this mission, but it was just something about the events that happened that made us hurry up and do it. We haven't told anyone except Lita.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo turned to Akane. \"That not a reason. That an excuse. You still should have told Shampoo.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane shifted uncomfortably. She was beginning to think that this wasn't the best idea she's had in the past few weeks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, Ranma didn't want you to be in any more pain. You were still getting over Mousse-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo cut her off. \"I NO GETTING OVER MOUSSE!\" She yelled. Shampoo took a deep breath and continued, this time more calmly. \"You do not get over someone you love dying. Would you get over Ranma death?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane didn't even want to think about it. \"I don't know.\" She said meekly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo turned back towards the stars. \"Shampoo would have been hurt, but would have understood.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm sorry,\" Akane said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo turned back to Akane. \"I'm sorry. That going around a lot lately. Everyone tell Shampoo that they sorry. Shampoo tired of hearing it. If Akane really were sorry you wouldn't have kept your marriage from Shampoo&hellip;\" Shampoo paused. \"&hellip;And wouldn't have married Ranma to begin with!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo, I love Ranma.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo loves Ranma too!\" She grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane just sat there, really not knowing what to say. Shampoo stood, and turned towards the door. \"Now, if Akane no mind, Shampoo have to get ready for work.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo walks out and into the hallway. Akane just remains seated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Damn.\" She mumbles.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo was in tears when she stepped off the turbo lift on deck four. She didn't really know if she was sad or mad or both. All she knew was that whatever the emotion was, it was making her cry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo was sick of crying. She knew it was all her fault though. If she hadn't gotten so damned attached to Ranma. She had known from nearly day one that he had no interest in her. She just thought that she would be able to sway his opinion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then there was Mousse. She knew that if she had bothered to tell him how she felt that things would have been different. He may still have died, but at least she wouldn't have to bear the pain of knowing that he never knew how she felt.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo closed her eyes to try and clear out the tears as she rounded a corner on the way to her quarters. Suddenly she ran into something.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm sorry!\" Jeff stated as he hit the ground. Shampoo also fell, the other way.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo's fault.\" Shampoo whimpered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff quickly stood and started to help her up. She accepted his assistance. Shampoo blinked a couple of times and recognized him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You the new councilor?\" Shampoo half asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff nodded. \"Lt. Jeff Fuchs.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo looked around, then grabbed Jeff by the arm and practically dragged him down the corridor and into her quarters.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We need to talk.\" She stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff nodded and sat down in a chair. Shampoo hopped onto her bed and sat facing him. Shampoo then proceeded to tell Jeff about everything.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After she finished Jeff thought for a few moments. He then cleared his throat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sometimes good intentions appear to be bad.\" He stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You saying what Ranma and Akane did was good intentions?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff nodded. \"They both knew how you felt about Ranma. They knew that telling you that they got married would hurt you. They honestly didn't want to hurt you anymore after what happened.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo nodded but didn't really take it too seriously, since that is what Ranma and Akane had been saying. It wasn't a valid explanation. Jeff sensed this and continued.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I will be the first one to say that they should have told you right away. But they didn't. You need to work on forgiving them.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Forgive them?\" Shampoo asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Forgiveness is the only way to free your own soul. It WILL make you feel better.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo sighed. \"So what? Shampoo just accepts marriage and say I forgive you for deceiving Shampoo?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff shook his head. \"You're under no obligation to accept the marriage. Though not accepting it isn't going to do you any good and may just cause more problems in the future. But you do need to get the two of them together, let them both know exactly how much that their deception hurt you, and let them know that you are ready to forgive them, as long as they promise to be honest with you from here on out.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo nods and smiles at Jeff. \"You really good.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff smiled back. \"Thanks. As for the issue with Mousse&hellip;\" Shampoo lost her smile. \"You cannot be expected to 'get over' his death. If that ever happened you would be a terrible person. You do need to accept it. Take comfort in knowing that he loved you. Find strength in knowing that he died in honor, protecting the person he loved and doing his duty. And know that deep down he knew you loved him too. When someone loves you, you know it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo nods once again and stands. Jeff also stands. Shampoo walks over to him and hugs him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You help Shampoo a lot today.\" Shampoo smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff smiled back. \"We all have a purpose. Mine is to help people get through times like this. Being alone in our pain is the worst thing that can happen. Anytime you need to talk, let me know.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo nods and watches Jeff walk out of her quarters. Shampoo sighs and goes to her closet and gets ready for work.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">At 05:30 all of the lights on the bridge and the rest of the ship shifted to full illumination. It was as close to sunrise as you are going to get on a starship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina quickly fills in Shampoo on the whole lot of nothing that went on that night. She then jaunts down to her quarters, gets changed, and goes straight to bed. Sleep eludes her for a few hours as her mind processes the decisions that she had made that night sitting on the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She had quietly logged in an appointment for 04:15 the next morning to get a physical and pregnancy test in sickbay. She had figured out exactly why she had slept with Ryouga and determined the best course of action for what was to happen next.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yup. Mina was ready now. All there was left to do was wait.</p>", "epilogue": false, "slug": "waiting", "story": 4}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.moontrekchapters", "pk": 24, "fields": {"chapter_number": 5, "title": "Invasion", "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor pushed the bushes that were in his and Foster's way to the ground and stepped over them. He then attempted to hold them down so that Foster could also get over them, but they slipped out of his grip and shot backward, knocking Foster flat on his ass.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you okay?\" Trevor asked a laughing Foster.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah,\" Foster replied as he stood and dusted himself off. \"I think I hurt my bottom parts, but other than that, I'm gravy.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor laughed. Foster eyed him confusedly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's funny?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor chuckled some more.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nobody says 'bottom' anymore. Except for maybe three-year-olds.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster shrugged. \"I'm seven hundred and three.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor laughed once again. \"Kid, you're alright!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster smiled at the compliment and the pair continued their trek through the woods to the stranded Runabout.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After about fifteen minutes of hiking, the pair could hear some voices screaming at them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What did they say?\" Foster asked Trevor who was increasing his walking speed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They said 'stop or I'll shoot'.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster halted in his position. \"Shouldn't we stop then?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor never turned back to his partner. \"No! We'll be arrested again!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ah &ndash; good point.\" Foster acknowledged as he scurried off to catch up with Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pair continued walking at an accelerated pace. They had just come over a small rise when a tree branch above them was shattered into twigs.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"HOLY SHIT!\" Trevor screamed. \"I thought 'stop or we'll shoot' was just an expression!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pair began to run as they are blanketed with projectile fire &ndash; the rounds missing them by mere inches.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The Runabout is just beyond these trees!\" Trevor pointed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster screamed and dropped to the ground. Trevor stopped and turned to his friend. \"What happened?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I think I have been shot.\" Foster dryly replied as he staggered to his feet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you going to be okay?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster laughed. \"Projectile weapons don't hurt energy beings.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A shot lands about two inches from Trevor. \"Well they sure as sugar hurt me, so we need to start running!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster nodded and the pair began to run again. Within moments they were at the Runabout with a Zima security officer right on their tails.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"STOP!\" He ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor opened the hatch and the pair jumped into the ship. Trevor jumps into his seat and begins to power up the craft. The Zima guard opened fire and bullets began to zing off the hull of the craft.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Won't those hurt the hull?\" Foster asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The ship is impacted by thousands of micro asteroids per minute while in space.\" The Ami-computer explained. \"Those bullets will do very minor damage if any.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor grabbed a phaser rifle and headed back to the door. Foster grabbed him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What are you doing?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We can't let them see us take off. I need to do what needs to be done to protect the prime directive.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster nods as Trevor hops outside and stuns the only visible guard. He quickly hops back in and takes his seat at the controls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The hatch closes and seals as the Runabout begins to lift into the air. Once a few meters in the air, Trevor swings the nose of the ship 180 degrees to face a clearing. The runabout slowly starts to move towards the clearing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After passing over some small hills, the pair see what seems like an entire battalion of guards, most armed with small arms, but a few armed with shoulder-mounted missile launchers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now, those will do a bit more damage than the bullets.\" Ami-Computer states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thank you very much, Captain obvious.\" Trevor groans. \"Shields?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Two percent.\" She replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ugh,\" Trevor replies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I can stop them.\" Foster pipes up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor, without even thinking about it, pushes the ship to its maximum incline and thruster speed. \"Do it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster nods and disappears. As the ship climbs Trevor sees all the guards drop to the ground, appearing to be in pain.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor stares at this for a moment till Foster reappears.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What did you do?\" Trevor asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"As you said, I did what needed to be done.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What does that mean?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster could sense some anger in Trevor's voice. \"I killed them.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor could only stare at Foster as the runabout climbed towards the cloud line; his staring only interrupted by the chirping of panels and Ami-Computer's voice piping in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor, three plasma-powered fighter aircraft with highly explosive missiles are on an intercept course. They will be within weapons range in three minutes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor just groaned and turned back to his piloting. \"We need to have a serious talk when we get out of this.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster sighed and took his seat in the back of the cabin.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sisko dropped out of warp at the very edge of sector Zulu 771. The smoothness of the stop implied that Ensign Ryouga Hibiki was off the clock.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Indeed he was.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga was hanging around ten-forward. He noted the stars slowing from the streaking warp effect to simply standing seemingly still.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hey.\" Mina's voice called to him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga turned and saw her standing behind him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hi.\" He stated. Ryouga turned back to his drink and resumed looking out the window.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you mind if I sit down?\" Mina asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga laughed. \"What's the difference? As you are so inclined to mention as much as you can you are my commanding officer.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sighed as she sat down. A waiter walked up to the table. Mina just shooed him away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga,\" Mina started. \"I just got back from sickbay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga shifted his eyes from the star field to Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And?\" He asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Negative,\" Mina replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sigh of relief from Ryouga could be heard back at Starfleet Command in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga smiled. \"Permission to speak freely?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I was going to do what you asked. I had never gotten drunk before, well not THAT drunk, and I know that you were very drunk too. I should have been able to control myself better.\" Ryouga stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina took a moment to take all that in before starting with her own speech.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, it's not your fault. I was also a willing participant in it. And I need to apologize for the way I reacted the next morning.\" Mina cleared her throat. \"I hope that everything is okay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga laughed. \"It was a little swollen, but no worse for the wear.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Still works?\" Mina asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga blushed. \"I think so.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina grinned. Ryouga was oblivious.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then he got it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT?\" He screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone in ten-forward turned and looked at the pair. Mina smacked Ryouga on the top of the head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Come on,\" Mina ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga blushed, grinned, and followed Mina out of the lounge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Behind the bar, Gosnell grinned. He hit his communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Gosnell to Gosnell.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Feedback spewed out of his communicator. He hit it again after several of the bar patrons gave him the evil eye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Stupid thing. Not me Gosnell! The other one!\" He hit his comm. badge once again. \"Gosnell to Commander Gosnell.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT!\" Lita yelled. \"Some of us are trying to sleep here!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sorry sweetie, just thought that you would want to know that Mina's getting some.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT?!?!?!\" She exclaimed. The signal went dead and within just a few seconds Lita materialized in front of the bar. Gosnell's jaw dropped when he saw his half-naked wife appear. He quickly grabbed a spare Starfleet uniform jacket from behind the bar and made her put it on.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's this about Mina getting some?\" Lita demanded the information.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She left with Ryouga.\" Gosnell grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita shook her head. \"That doesn't mean anything.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell grinned. \"He had the look.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What look?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell sighed. \"Are we having sex tonight?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Probably,\" Lita replied quietly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell got a big dopey grin on his face. Lita's eyes opened wide. Gosnell started to laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That look.\" He giggled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita grinned. She then took a seat at the bar. \"Give me a Mountain Dew.\" She said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell shook his head negatively. \"Not till you go put some pants on.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita suddenly realized that under the Starfleet jacket she was only wearing her underwear. Lita hit her comm. badge. \"Execute site to site transport pattern Lita 7 G.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer chirped an acknowledgment and she vanished into nothingness.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The Sisko has entered the sector,\" George stated to his siblings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tatewaki Kuno grinned. He walked over to the control panel. \"Time to smite!\" he grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Brother dear&hellip;\" Kodachi grumbled. \"You aren't thinking of hurting my darling Ranma.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh for fucks sake,\" George grumbled as he entered the intercept coordinates into the computer. Tatewaki drew his bokken and took up a fighting stance across the way from his sister.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"My goal is to rescue the fair Akane Tendo and my beloved pig-tailed girl. If Saotome is to be destroyed it will be just a nice coincidence.\" Kuno stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi glowered. \"That wretched Akane Tendo will NOT be brought aboard this ship as long as I am here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I can fix that!\" Kuno bellowed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"ON GUARD, BROTHER DEAR!\" Kodachi retorted.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shaddup both of you!\" George yelled, besting them both with two phaser blasts. The two siblings fell to the ground, stunned but unharmed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tatewaki staggers to his feet and draws his bokken on George. \"How dare you fire upon the blue-\" Kuno is cut off as George raises the phaser to bear on him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You want some more?\" George asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tatewaki re-holsters his bokken. \"The mission at hand is of utmost importance. I yield for now, but we will finish this later.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi also staggers to her feet. \"I DO NOT YIELD!\" She screams as she charges the two Kuno boys with her rhythmic gymnastic ribbon twirling. George fires one shot, knocking her back on her ass.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tatewaki grins slightly. Kodachi returns to her feet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, the mission at hand is what we need to concentrate on. We'll settle this later.\" Kodachi cackles and flutters out of the room rose petals flying in every direction.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George merely shakes his head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are these drones of yours going to work?\" He asks Tatewaki.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you doubt the workmanship of the house of Kuno?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George eyes his brother for a moment, then speaks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No. Just curious.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno nods. \"Yes, they have been programmed to capture Akane Tendo and the pig-tailed girl. They have also been programmed to kill Ranma Saotome.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George nods. \"Good. Five minutes to intercept.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno looks at the panel. \"What about that ship?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George shrugs. \"The neuron-radiation jammer will keep the Sisko from contacting them. After we are done with Ranma we can blow them up later.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno cackles. George just groans.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo was playing a computer game on Ranma's command panel when Ranma walked onto the bridge. Shampoo quickly turned it off and moved to her own seat. Ranma just chuckled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You don't have to stop on my account.\" He said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo just shrugged. \"Shampoo losing anyway.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded and took his seat. He looked at the viewscreen. The stars seemed to just be sitting there.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stared a bit closer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those stars are doing something odd. He thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The stars in the center of the view screen seemed to move position ever so slightly, and then back to where they were. Ranma had seen that before.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Holy shit.\" He said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before he could say anything else the Kuno cube de-cloaked and stopped right in front of the Sisko.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo hopped out of her seat. Ranma stood as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SHIELDS!\" They cried in unison.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The humming of the shields kicked in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RED ALERT!\" Ranma yelled. \"ALL SENIOR OFFICERS TO THE BRIDGE!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">In Mina's quarters:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina was straddling Ryouga. They were both under the covers. Mina was passionately kissing Ryouga. He was more than grateful to return the kisses, albeit very sloppily. Ryouga didn't do this type of thing too often. He wasn't very good at it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina moved her attention down from Ryouga's face to his neck. Ryouga stroked Mina's back, his hands moving up and down from the top of her back to the bottom of her buttocks, as she nibbled on his neck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina started to move lower. She ran her tongue on Ryouga's muscular chest. She gave Ryouga's man nipples some attention as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga moaned in pleasure. Mina continued down. Her tongue making a trail that led down Ryouga's midsection, past his waist, lower and down to his-</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RED ALERT! ALL SENIOR OFFICERS TO THE BRIDGE!\" Ranma's voice bellowed over the P.A., followed by the red alert klaxons.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sat up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SON OF A BITCH!\" They both screamed in unison.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">In Serena's quarters:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena was up earlier than usual. She wasn't dressed yet though. She was still wearing her cute little cotton bra and panty set that she slept in. They were cute because they had little bunnies on them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena sighed. She didn't want to go and sit in ten-forward until breakfast time. Gosnell was very strict. He wouldn't serve Lucky Charms till 06:30. She didn't understand why not. She guessed it was just to make sure that no one else but she got any.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena walked over to her recliner and sat down. She looked at a book that was sitting on the coffee table next to the chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do I have time?\" She pondered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She nodded to herself that she did. She leaned back in her chair and got a bit more comfortable. She pushed a button that causes the footrest to come out. She knew this would be easier with her feet up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She closed her eyes and allowed her hand to wander up and down the side of her leg.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her hand stopped near her hips. She sighed in pleasure. She pulls out a remote control from between the arm of the chair and the cushion. She pointed it at a video screen on the wall and hit a button.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cat Girl Nuku Nuku appeared on the viewer. She grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now that's the stuff!\" She exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RED ALERT! ALL SENIOR OFFICERS TO THE BRIDGE!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"DAMMIT!\" She whimpered as she hopped out of her chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">In Ten-Forward:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita walks back into the lounge. She sees the bar very busy and her husband taking breakfast orders. She looks around for Raye or Serena but sees neither of them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell looks up and acknowledges her presence. Lita smiles and walks up to the bar. She takes a seat near the middle. Gosnell walks up to her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'll get you your Dew in just a minute, babe.\" He states as he runs over to take some more orders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita smiles. She's been looking forward to this since she got up this morning. Well, this and the eventual drilling she was going to give Mina about the drilling Ryouga gave her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yeah, this is going to be a great day! She thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gosnell walked back up to her with a big glass of the green bubbly liquid that she has grown to love &ndash; no &ndash; need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thanks, babe!\" She says, giving him a quick peck. Gosnell blushes and smiles then resumes his duties.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita picks up the glass.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She brings it close to her lips.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?\" Someone yells.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita sets the glass down and turns towards the windows. Outside there is an enormous cube-shaped ship towering over the relatively small Sisko.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RED ALERT! ALL SENIOR OFFICERS TO THE BRIDGE!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aw shit,\" Lita complains, hopping out of her seat and running off, her Mountain Dew untouched.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">In Raye's quarters:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff lights a candle. He places it in the center of the floor. He then sits on one side of it Indian style.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a few moments, Raye walks in. She looks different, Jeff notices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye was brushing her long flowing hair. She is letting it go loose like she used to do. Her uniform is in perfect condition. All her pips accounted for and lined up straight. Her communicator perfectly aligned where it should be.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye sets the brush down on her nightstand. She walks over and takes a seat on the other side of the candle, across from Jeff. Jeff smiles at her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I like your hair much better that way.\" He notes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye smiles. \"Thanks! I do too.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why were you wearing it the other way then?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye frowns. \"Just didn't feel like going through the trouble.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff nods. \"Okay. Silence is necessary.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, yeah,\" Raye mumbles. \"Computer, deactivate all audio in the room.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer chirps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay. Breathe deep. One. Two. Three.\" Jeff instructed as both he and Raye went into a deep meditative trance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly the alert light in Raye's quarters started to flash, but no sound was heard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">In Sickbay:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane was walking around, checking to make sure that everything was in order. She had nurses and assistants to do all that but sometimes she was just so damned bored she had to do it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once she was done with her rounds she went into her office and sat down. She tapped some buttons on her computer, then shut it off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Activate E.M.H.\" She ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The holographic doctor appeared. \"Please state the nature of the medical emergency.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you have to say that every time you appear?\" Akane asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh, I don't know. I guess it would be useful if you ever actually activated me in an emergency.\" It smugly replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane just glared at it. Akane had to be the only one who could put the fear of God in a holograph.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I need to know how to deliver a baby,\" Akane said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Is someone pregnant?\" The holograph asked. \"The medical files don't say anything about that.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander Mina Aino might be,\" Akane replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Her last physical was this morning at 0522. She was also given a pregnancy test and it came up negative.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Akane asked, and punched up Mina's file confirming what the E.M.H. just informed her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"As CMO you should pay a bit more attention to what is going on in Sickbay.\" The holograph stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"End program,\" Akane growled. The E.M.H. vanished.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane sighed and kicked her feet up and onto her desk. She pulled a pack of smokes and a lighter from out of her pocket. She also grabs her ashtray from out of her desk. She lights up and leans back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane takes a deep drag on the cigarette.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RED ALERT! ALL SENIOR OFFICERS TO THE BRIDGE!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sudden blaring of Ranma's voice over the P.A. startled her. She started to fall backward. She flailed her arms in a pathetic attempt to regain her balance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She failed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane went crashing to the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Son of a bitch.\" She cursed while still lying on the deck.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sisko was sitting about 30,000 meters from the Kuno cube. The Sisko looked absolutely minuscule in comparison. This Kuno cube was over thirty times bigger than the first one they had come in contact with.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Side by side it looked like Verne Troyer (Mini-Me) standing next to Louie Anderson. It didn't seem like a fair fight at all.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If Ranma was worried though, you couldn't tell. He simply looked at the cube that completely filled the viewscreen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo on the other hand was awe-struck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It so big!\" She commented.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"Tactical analysis.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo checked her display. \"They have the usual Kuno weapons. Torpedoes, phasers, cutting beam. Nothing special.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing special. That thought bounced around in Ranma's head. Could the Kuno's just have been bluffing to see if Ranma would actually turn himself over to them?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They're hailing us.\" The tactical officer announced.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The turbolift doors opened and Serena and Lita walked onto the bridge. The tactical officer acknowledged Lita and turned the station over to her. Serena took a spot next to Lita.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"On screen,\" Ranma ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita complied and George Kuno appeared.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hi-diddly-hi!\" George grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma snickered. \"I'm Captain Ranma-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George wouldn't let him finish. \"I know who you are Captain. Please lower your shields and prepare to be boarded.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It's about this time that Ryouga and Mina entered the bridge. Mina scurried down to her station but Ryouga walked a bit slower. He also made a point to keep his hands in front of him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In front of you know what.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma laughed at George's arrogance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'll do no such thing!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George sighed. \"Look, man. I don't have anything against you personally. The first time we tangled I wanted to blow you out of the sky just because father wanted to.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma put his finger up to stop George.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George sighed. \"Yes, I know I'm black. I'm adopted, okay?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma put his finger down. George continued.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Here is the deal. I can't sleep because of you. That nutball brother of mine has dreams of killing you and he constantly has to scream in them. Then he has dreams of deflowering your other half.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma put his finger up again. Again George sighed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, I know that you and the pig-tailed girl are one in the same. As I stated before, I'm adopted.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma puts his finger down again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Then there is Kodachi! I'm not even going to tell you the horrible things she dreams about!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nods. \"I doubt I'd want to hear about them anyway.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George nods back. \"At any rate, for this to come to an end you must lower your shields and allow us to board. You, along with Akane Tendo and Shampoo will be taken prisoner. The rest of your crew will go on to live long and happy lives, free to pursue both economical and spiritual enlightenment.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo stands. \"WHY SHAMPOO?!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George grins. \"Cause I think you're hot. I got myself some of that Amazon Jungle Fever. And shouldn't I think about myself every now and then?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo just looks at Ranma. \"He crazy!\" She notes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nods. \"Sorry. You want to come over you are going to have to do it the hard way.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George nods. \"Okay then. See you in a few.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The communication ends. Ranma sighs as Lita's terminal starts to chirp.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They're powering up their forward torpedo bays.\" She informs Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Fire at will.\" Ranma dryly replies, sitting in his seat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nods.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sisko unleashes a tremendous amount of both normal and quantum torpedoes, along with every forward phaser bank. The torpedoes impact the cube with an incredible explosion. Once the smoke had cleared everyone was surprised to see the cube not only in one piece, but&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">seemingly unscathed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Ranma asked no one.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita prepared to fire again when several silver streaks of light come flying out of the cube and impact the Sisko's shields.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ship shakes violently. Panels explode. Pointless steam ducts spray people with steam.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SHIELDS DOWN TO 60 PERCENT!\" Lita yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RETURN FIRE! FULL SPREAD OF QUANTUM TORPEDOES!\" Ranma yelled back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita complied. Quantum torpedoes came from every torpedo bay on the Sisko. They impacted the cube, one after the other. Immediately following the impact multiple standard torpedoes fired and impacted the cube.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They are taking damage,\" Lita responded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo checked her display. \"Target weapons, engines.\" Shampoo ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita complied and fired again.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cube also fired its weapon again. The torpedoes passed each other on the way to their respective targets.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Sisko got slammed once again knocking people in every which direction.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cube also took a tremendous amount of damage from the quantum torpedo regular torpedo volleys.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shields at 10 percent!\" Lita said. \"The cube's engines are offline, but her weapons-\" Lita didn't need to finish. Six more of the silver torpedoes streaked towards the Sisko, slamming into her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SHIELDS DOWN! HULL BREACH DECK 3, SECTION 16. EMERGENCY FORCE FIELD IN PLACE!\" Lita stated as she returned fire.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The next volley of torpedoes from the Sisko all struck in the same place. Right where the silver torpedoes were coming from. A massive explosion came from that section blowing debris out into space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There was an eerie silence for a few moments while everyone regained their bearings. Lita was the first to speak.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Their weapons are offline.\" She reported.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Get our shields up,\" Ranma ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Working on it, sir,\" Serena replied from the engineering station on the aft section of the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Too late,\" Lita said. \"We've been boarded.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How many?\" Shampoo asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"50,\" Lita replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looked at Shampoo who returned the look. Ranma turned back to Lita. \"Where at?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita checked her display. \"Deck three, section five.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma's stomach dropped. \"Sickbay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stood and turned to Shampoo. \"You have the bridge.\" He stated as he walked to the turbo lift. Shampoo turned to Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You have bridge.\" She stated walking over to Ranma. Lita eyed the pair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I have a security team en route.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shook his head. \"Sickbay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita understood. \"I'm coming with you then.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. Ryouga stood, once again shielding his groin from view.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ranma.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma turned. \"Don't worry. I need you here in case we need to get lost.\" Ranma laughed at his own joke.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga scowled for a bit before he got the play on words. Once he was sure Ranma was gone he laughed as well.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What an ass.\" Ryouga giggled.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The trio exited the turbo lift on deck three. Yelling and phaser fire could be heard down the hallways. Lita walked up to a wall panel. She ran her hand along the back of the crease until she found a button. She hit it and a section of the wall opened up revealing four phaser rifles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita tossed one to Ranma, one to Shampoo, and kept the other two for herself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The trio quietly made their way down the hall. They stopped when they saw what appeared to be Tatewaki Kuno lying dead on the floor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma checked it for a pulse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nothing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain,\" Lita called. Ranma ran over to where she was. There was another Tatewaki on the ground. This one also had no pulse.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They looked up the hall. The floor was strewn with Tatewakis. Ranma was befuddled. He didn't think that Kuno was narcissistic enough to make an entire army in his image.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They robots!\" Shampoo noted as she pointed to one of the Kunos busted open head. There were wires and chips sticking out of, as well as a blue ooze dripping from the wound.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The trio continued on. Every now and then they would find a security officer lying on the ground. Lita would stop and check for a pulse. They all had one. The Kunos were apparently just stunning the resistance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The group advanced towards Sickbay.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"LET GO OF ME!\" Akane's voice screamed from inside the sickbay doors.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma opened the doors and saw a Kuno drone dragging Akane by her wrist. He noticed Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I SHALL SMITE THE!\" The drone yelled in a Kuno/Robot voice.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The drone let go of Akane and charged at Ranma. Ranma fired his phaser. The blast hit the drone sending his internal parts flying out of the back of him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Several other drones walked over and started their attack on the trio. As Ranma and the other fought another drone grabbed Akane and flung her over his shoulder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The drone carried Akane out the second set of sickbay doors. As soon as Ranma and the others finished off the drones they pursued the drone that had Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RANMA!\" Akane yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'M COMING, AKANE!\" Ranma called back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly another dozen drones materialized in front of them. A couple of them went to help the one drone with Akane, the others stayed to stall Ranma and the group.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Engineering to Saotome!\" Serena's voice called.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma ignored her but Lita answered. \"What is it, Serena?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh-Lita?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, what is it, Serena?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I have shields back in place. No more will be beaming over, and they can't beam back out unless they use a transporter room.\" Serena explained over the comm. system.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Acknowledged.\" Lita slapped her badge and fired at one of the drones.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma was more interested in avoiding the drones and catching up with Akane than he was with shooting them. The only ones he shot were ones that were directly in his path with no way around them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RANMA!\" Akane screamed helplessly as the Kuno drones carried her off and down the Sisko's corridors.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma ran after them, followed by Shampoo and Lita. Lita drew her phaser rifle to bear and fired once, striking one of the drones. The drone collapsed in a shower of sparks. The drone carrying Akane kept walking. Three of the other drones turned and faced the trio.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita fired again striking the next drone. He also went down in a heap, sparks flying from his torso.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo fired this time; however, her phaser blast hit the drone and dissipated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They've adapted!\" Lita yelled, starting to back away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We can't let them take Akane!\" Ranma yelled back, continuing forward.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nodded and ran up to one of the drones, and smashed her rifle over its head. The rifle broke into a thousand pieces, but the crude attack was effective. The drone fell over, a gooey blue ooze coming from its wounds. Lita looked at the ooze and gagged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another drone charged at Ranma. He quickly jumped over it and continued after the drone carrying Akane.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo smiled at the drone as she did some very impressive Amazon ninja-like attacks, sending the drone into oblivion, blue ooze coming from gashes on its body.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nice,\" Lita commented, running after her captain.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo smiled and ran after Lita. \"Shampoo got blue ooze on her boot!\" She complained.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RANMA!\" Akane cried while pounding and kicking the drone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma jumped over and dodged the Kuno drones that had already been bested. He couldn't stop. He had to get to Akane before the drone reached the transporter room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita and Shampoo finally caught up with Ranma. The three of them ran around a corner to find themselves face to face with about thirty of the Kuno look-a-likes. Ranma could do nothing as he watched the screaming Akane be carried off into transporter room six. He could do nothing as he heard the transporters energize.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Anger swelled in Ranma's face. Shampoo and Lita stared at him as he began to glow bright red.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the?\" Lita pondered. She was soon grabbed by Shampoo who pulled her into a doorway.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma started to laugh in his anger. The Kuno drones moved ever so close to him. They all in unison drew their bokkens.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Fucking Kuno's.\" Ranma laughed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Kuno's raised their bokkens and prepared to land their blows on their sworn enemy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma crouched and placed his arms straight in front of him, his palms out facing his enemy. \"Hiryu Shoten Ha!\" Ranma screamed. The ki blast was unbelievable. The glowing sphere that blasted from Ranma's hands cut through all the Kunos, through the door to the transporter room, and through the wall behind that, creating a passageway into cargo bay five.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma dropped to his knees exhausted. His breathing was somewhat shallow, but it wasn't due to the energy drain of his ki blast.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma raised his arm up enough to discreetly wipe the moisture that was forming in his eyes. He stood and turned to where Shampoo was. Lita was still hiding in the doorway. Ranma regained his composure and started to speak to his first officer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm going over there,\" Ranma stated quite matter-of-factly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Not alone you not.\" Shampoo replied in the same tone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo &ndash;\" Ranma started. Shampoo shook her head. Ranma stopped speaking.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo know how it feel to lose someone you love. Shampoo no want Ranma to have to go through what Shampoo go through.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo thought for a second.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo want to protect Ranma from the pain.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma managed a weak grin. \"Thank you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma remembered his feeble lie to her about wanting to protect her from the pain she would feel in knowing that he and Akane were married. Ranma knew, however, that Shampoo was not lying to him. She cared about him. She cared enough to let go. She cared enough to help him get back his true love.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was about this time that Lita wandered out of her hiding place. She examined the left-overs of the Kuno drones. She then stared in awe at the remains of the wall behind them. She then noticed that she could see all the way into cargo bay five.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Jesus Christ!\" She exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ready?\" Ranma asked Shampoo.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Huh?\" Lita asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We're going to the Kuno ship to get Akane back,\" Ranma said, starting to walk away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hey, hey, hey!\" Lita protested. Ranma stopped and turned back to her. \"You two are not going over there without me.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This isn't your fight,\" Ranma stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita pointed to the wall. \"Look what they did to my ship!\" Lita corrected herself. \"I mean your ship.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma raised an eyebrow. \"I actually did that.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nodded. \"Yes, but you wouldn't have if it wasn't for them. Besides, if you get killed guess who gets their ass chewed out? Me, that's who.\" Lita starts to flail her arms in overdramatizing her point.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm chief of security. Your security is my business. Guess what that means, Captain! I go where you go. Oh yes, I'm going, that's final.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma laughed. \"Fine.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nodded at her victory. She wasn't going to let the Kuno's get away with coming in here, shooting her security personnel and making her not be able to drink her Mountain Dew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I guess Gosnell was right! That stuff is addictive! She thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita shook off her thought. She realized she could not let them get away with this. No, they were going to pay and pay big.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aino to Saotome!\" Mina's voice called over the comm.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, Commander?\" Ranma answered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">On the bridge:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain, the Kuno ship is starting to move away. It appears that they have their engines working again.\" Mina replied from the captain's seat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Immobilize them. DO NOT destroy them, but stop them.\" Ranma ordered. \"I, Commander Shampoo, and Commander Gosnell are going over there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina laughed. She would never be used to hearing the phrase 'Commander Gosnell'.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why did she have to marry someone with such a funny name? She thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Did you get that, Commander?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shook off her giggles. \"Yes sir. I'll take care of it.\" She replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina stood and turned to the helm.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga, set course 1-0-2 mark 0-0-7, engage at full impulse on my mark.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aye,\" Ryouga mumbled, adjusting himself slightly to hide the woody he still had.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Tactical. Prepare one full volley of photon torpedoes from all dorsal tubes. Target their engines. Fire on my mark.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aye!\" The tactical officer stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina let the Kuno ship drift away a bit further before-</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"HELM!\" She yelled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga complied and the ship shot forward towards the ship, catching up with it very quickly. It appeared that they might collide with the Kuno cube but the seven-degree downward pitch of the Sisko was taking them lower than the cube.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"FIRE!\" Mina screamed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Torpedoes a plenty burst from the ship's three dorsal launchers. They all impacted the Kuno's engine array located along the bottom of the cube. The Kuno ship drifted to a stop.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga, bring us about. Tactical, if they try and move again, fire another volley of torpedoes at their engines. Be careful not to destroy them. We have officers over there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The tactical officer acknowledged Mina's command. Ryouga hit some commands into his station and the ship very quickly, and very roughly, pulled a 180. Any crew member that was standing was sent to the deck. Mina happened to be standing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Damn it Hibiki!\" She snarled.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the armory, Ranma was passing out phaser rifles to his two female assistants. All three of them had taken off their uniform jackets. Now they were simply clad in the grey sleeveless shirts, black uniform pants, and their boots. They had reapplied their communicators to&nbsp;their undershirts.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita did some work on a tricorder for a moment. She then connected it to her phaser rifle. It chirped a few times and she nodded. Lita went over to Ranma and Shampoo's rifles and did the same thing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The blast yield and frequency should modulate randomly enough so the Kunos won't be able to adapt as quickly,\" Lita explained.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"As quickly?\" Shampoo worriedly asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nodded. \"Their technology is very advanced. It won't take very long for them to figure out the mathematics behind the frequency change.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I did, however, program each rifle differently, so it should take longer for all three to become useless.\" Lita finished, slinging her rifle over her shoulder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good job, Commander.\" Ranma nodded. \"Now, let's go.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two girls nodded and followed their commanding officer out of the armory. They walked down the hall and past the trashed corridor leading to transporter room one. Ranma's blast had demolished the control computer so they would have to walk down to transporter room two, just a section away.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma thought to himself along the way. He thought that he was stupid for allowing Akane to be put in the position that she was in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma worried what kind of positions Kuno would try and put Akane into. Ranma shuddered at that thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also shuddered at the thought of Kuno turning Akane into one of them. Into placing her into the Kuno collective. Ranma didn't know if he could remain married to her if she was going to be spouting off bad Shakespeare.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma kicked himself slightly for thinking of such a silly thing at such a serious time. He knew that it was a possibility that he would never see Akane again if the Kunos were to escape.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He also knew that there was a possibility that they would be able to use their new weapon on Earth and that was also unacceptable.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The trio arrived at transporter room two. The transporter chief acknowledged them as they entered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Off to kick some ass?\" He mused.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nodded. \"What gave it away?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's a tradition in Starfleet that when you are off to kick some ass you do it in just the sleeveless undershirts.\" He replied as he punched some commands into his console.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where do you think they took her?\" Lita asked Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma knew exactly where they took her. \"Chief, put us a couple of decks below the main control center of the ship.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes sir.\" He replied. \"Ready.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Energize,\" Ranma ordered as the three disappeared off the pad.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I THOUGHT THEY DID NOT HAVE SPACE FLIGHT!\" Trevor screamed as machine-gun fire pelted his Runabout.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I said they don't have warp drive.\" The computer replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor groaned. Foster looked to Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I can stop them.\" He stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, thank you.\" Trevor snarled. \"You've done quite enough for me today.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster looked at his feet. \"I was only trying to help.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"If you want to help, fix the warp drive!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I can't fix mechanical things,\" Foster replied quietly. \"And if I use my power to give us a boost we could end up in another galaxy.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor just groaned. \"How much longer till we breach the outer atmosphere?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer thought about this for a moment. \"One minute.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Can they follow us that far in those things?\" Trevor said, grabbing his console as the ship shook as the bullets began to penetrate the Runabout's shields.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, but the projectile weapons and missiles shouldn't be as effective.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How far out is the Crossroads?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer thought for a few more moments. \"77 thousand kilometers.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor groaned. He knew that if they followed him that far and saw the Crossroads he would have blown the prime directive all to hell. He knew that even though he would like to escape, he couldn't let that happen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor, I can stop them without killing them,\" Foster said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor thought about this for a bit. The last time that Foster said that several people were killed. Granted they were trying to kill him, but they thought he was a threat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor, they are still low enough they can eject from their ships and parachute down to the planet.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer agreed. \"We're only at 8 kilometers.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They should be wearing oxygen masks,\" Foster added.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay, okay!\" Trevor yelled. \"But if you kill them I am going to be SUPER pissed.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster nodded and vanished. Moments later Trevor watched the wings on one, then the next, then the final aircraft fall off. The jets started to plummet and sure enough, the canopies blew off and the pilots ejected. They floated softly and quietly back down to the planet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"There are eight more on an intercept course.\" The computer informed Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Right,\" Trevor replied, checking his displays. \"Will we beat them out of the atmosphere?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes.\" She answered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay, as soon as we are clear of the atmosphere set a course for the farthest moon, full impulse.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer chirped a reply.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Will we be safe there?\" Foster asked as he reappeared in the seat next to Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes. The moon will shield us from their primitive radar. Plus we can outrun them at impulse so we will be able to find a good crater to hide in before they even get there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster smiled. He looked down at the display screen. He then turned back to Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I thought you said there was only one Federation ship in this sector.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah,\" Trevor replied. \"The Crossroads.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That's Ami's ship.\" The computer helpfully added.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor blushed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I see a second one. And then a third ship that's not Federation.\" Foster stated, pointing the blips out to Trevor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor read the display and snarled. \"Why didn't you tell me there was another ship out there?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It wasn't there last time I checked.\" The computer replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Dammit!\" Trevor said. \"I'm removing your AI chip when this is over with. You're developing an attitude.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer made a noise that can only be described as a computer blowing raspberries at him. Trevor just returned the sentiment as the ship left the planet's atmosphere and shot off towards the moon at full impulse.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The battle had startled both Raye and Jeff out of deep meditation. Raye honestly couldn't be happier. She was tired of these sessions. Sure, they were helping her deal with the memories, but to deal with them she had to remember them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff stood. He helped Raye to her feet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Lights.\" He called out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lights came on. Raye looked at him and nodded. \"A jolt that strong can't be Hibiki. I better get to the bridge.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff nodded and they walked to the doors. They refused to open.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell?\" Raye asked. She pushed some buttons on the panel next to the door. They simply chirped in a noncompliant sort of way.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Computer, why won't the doors open?\" Jeff asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"General quarters have been sounded.\" The computer replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHY?\" Raye yelled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Intruder alert.\" The computer answered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye slapped her comm. badge. \"Hino to bridge.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Go ahead, Raye.\" Mina's voice replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's going on?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm a little too busy to explain it now,\" Mina stated. \"But we've been boarded.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you need me up there?\" Raye asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No.\" Mina dryly replied. \"The safest place for you is to stay in your quarters. I'll call you back later. Aino out.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The comm. signal terminated. Raye sighed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I guess we're stuck here.\" Jeff mused. \"What do you want to do?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I sure as hell don't want to do anymore meditating,\" Raye grumbled. Jeff nodded and walked over to her bed. He sat down on it. He patted the seat next to him. Raye raised an eyebrow.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't think we should do that either.\" She stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff laughed. \"No, no.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye cautiously walked over and sat down on her bed next to him. Jeff smiled and scooted over to the other end of the bed. He stuck his hand in his pocket and pulled out a deck of playing cards.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You play poker?\" he asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye cocked her head slightly. \"A little.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff nodded. He turned towards the replicator. \"Two beers, 8 degrees, M.G.D. circa 2003.\" The replicator complied and two beers appeared. Jeff hopped off the bed, walked over, grabbed the beers, and returned to his sitting position on Raye's bed. He handed Raye one of the beers. \"You want to deal?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye took the cards from him. She looked at the backs of the cards. On the back was the Starfleet Medical logo. She then turned the cards over and on the front of each card was a different picture of a Starfleet psychiatrist. Raye laughed when she saw the card with Jeff's picture on it. He had a beatnik-looking goatee.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I was going through a phase,\" Jeff replied to Raye's unanswered question.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye laughed again as she shuffled the cards and started to deal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The game is seven-card stud.

But the Runabout is small enough to mostly avoid their planetary radar and observation stations, but we are not. We will be detected if we get any closer.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"BAH!\" Ami grunted. \"Is the Runabout in any danger?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vong checked. \"Yes, but it's no Kuno cube.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami nodded. \"Set a course for the Sisko then.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The helmsman hesitated slightly, but then once he was sure that no one was going to be changing their minds again, did what he was told. The Crossroads swoops around and starts to move towards the Sisko.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander?\" The tactical officer called to Mina who was going over damage reports with an engineer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, Lieutenant?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am getting what appears to be a sensor blip of a Sovereign-class starship about 30 million kilometers from here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Appears to be?\" Mina pondered. \"You can't be certain?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Lieutenant shook his head. \"No ma'am. The Kuno's appear to be giving off some sort of radiation that is interfering with our sensors.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Can you hail them?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'll try.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The tactical officer hit some buttons. The monitor went to some very bad static, but a silhouette was slightly visible through it. The shape spoke some words, but they were very garbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This is the best I can do.\" He stated. \"But they do appear to be moving closer.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Crap.\" Mina groaned. She stands and turns towards the engineering station. \"Serena &ndash; you need to get the communications system working so that we can get through the interference. We need to make sure that they don't engage the Kuno cube while the others are over there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena nods an acknowledgment and motions for the engineer that was with Mina to come with her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sits back down and sighs. \"Keep trying to send a message through to tell them NOT to fire on the cube.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Lieutenant nods and returns to his work.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma could only stare in awe at what he saw. The inside of the Kuno cube was wallpapered with posters of his self, well, herself, and of Akane. He knew that the guy had an obsession, but this was sick. There was even a picture of her when she got sick on Tijuana 3, and, well spoiled the crystal beaches, if you know what I mean.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Wow.\" Lita gasped. \"This guy really digs you and Commander Tendo.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma weakly nodded. Shampoo giggled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He in love!\" Shampoo added.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma just growled at Shampoo and walked to a doorway. He checks a tricorder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"According to the scans we had done just before we left, this is Kuno's master bedroom that we are in,\" Ranma said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I didn't think that the Kuno's slept?\" Lita asked as she pawed through some of the stuffed girl-type Ranma figurines that Kuno had in multiple, unhealthy positions, on his dresser.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well,\" Ranma murmured. \"I suppose that 'regeneration chamber' would be more of an accurate term.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nodded and walked over to the doorway where her bosses were.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now, through here is Kodachi's master regeneration chamber is.\" Ranma nodded to Lita.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nodded back and moved in front, her phase rifle drawn. Ranma crouched down and hit some buttons on his tricorder. The seal on the door released and it slid open slowly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Through the door, the room was very dark. Lita quickly put on some night vision glasses and slinked in. Once she was sure the room was clear she started to search for a light switch. She found one. She flipped on the lights and looked around.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Holy shit!\" She exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The room was not only wallpapered with pictures of Ranma, but it was also carpeted. And that's not all. Kodachi also had Ranma curtains surrounding her regeneration pod. There was a Ranma clock on the wall, a Ranma calendar, and an Akane dartboard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo just laughed. Ranma scowled as he pulled the dartboard down and broke it in half.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita snickered. \"I hope you got some residuals for all this merchandise.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma just groaned and walked to the next door. He checked his tricorder and nodded to the pair. They didn't notice him though. They were both busy digging through one of Kodachi's drawers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma cleared his throat to gain their attention, but only got a laugh. He cocks his head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's funny?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo turned to Ranma. \"Can you shake?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Huh?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo shimmied a little. \"Shake!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shrugged and also shimmied. Lita fell to the floor laughing, Shampoo just grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This does it better!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo tosses Ranma something. He looks at it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"OH MY GOD!\" Ranma screams and drops the device.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo starts to laugh. \"It a Ranma vibrator!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I know what it is. Let's go NOW.\" Ranma bellowed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita and Shampoo tried their best to regain their composure and walked over to the door. Ranma shook off the disgust. Not so much the disgust that his face was on a vibrator, but the disgust that he touched something that had been somewhere he NEVER wants to be.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now, through this door is George's chamber. After that, we will be in the main corridor.\" Ranma explained.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nodded and again took her place in the front. Ranma released the seal on the door. Like the last room, this one was also dark. Lita quickly cleared the room and turned on the lights.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WOW!\" Lita exclaimed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George's room had no posters. No wallpaper, no carpet. It was very drone-ish.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">All George had was a cold metal grey desk with a small engraved piece of wood on it. Shampoo went over to inspect it. She read the engraving.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo beautiful eyes.\" Shampoo said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Is he saying you have beautiful eyes, or is that where he wants to mount your beautiful eyes?\" Lita asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo have no desire to find out.\" Shampoo stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma shushed them as he walked over to another door. \"I have one bio-sign behind this door.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita and Shampoo scurried over to the door. Ranma disengaged the seal and Lita peaked in. It looked like a bathroom. The tub was full of water. Lita slowly moved in, with the other two behind her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita looked around and didn't see anything. Ranma checked his tricorder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's still in here.\" He whispered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly the lights went out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">WHOOSH!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Something zips right past them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"BEHIND US!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">WHOOSH!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"IN FRONT OF US!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">WHOOSH!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHERE IS IT?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">WHOOSH! \"BWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The trio screams as they start to fall backward.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Has anyone seen Ensign Hibiki?\" Mina asked the rest of the bridge crew.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone shook their heads to report that no; they have not seen Ryouga lately. He seemed to disappear without anyone noticing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina groaned. \"Computer, where is Ensign Ryouga Hibiki?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The computer replies. \"Ensign Hibiki is not on board.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where is he?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ensign Hibiki transported off the ship via transporter room seven at 0722 hours.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And where did he go?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Transporter records are unavailable during a network virus scan. Please ask again later. Twelve billion files scanned, sixty-seven trillion, nine hundred eight billion-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shut up.\" Mina interrupted. She then groaned to herself. \"Why the hell is there a virus scan running NOW anyway?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sighed and walked back to the communications station. \"Any luck contacting the other ship yet?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The operator shook his head. \"No, but the signal is improving. We should be able to contact them in six minutes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's the time till the ship is in weapons range of the cube?\" Mina asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Four minutes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Not good enough,\" Mina complained. She then tapped her communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aino to Tskunio. Serena, we need communications up in three minutes!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena nods, not even realizing that Mina cannot see her nodding. She then taps her badge and goes to help the engineers working on the communications equipment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What if we launched a relay probe?\" One of the engineers stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Can we get one ready in time?\" Another asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We should have one ready now, for when we pass through subspace variances.\" A third added.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'll get it launched!\" A fourth said.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'll call the bridge!\" A final one noted</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">All five engineers scurried off in opposite directions. Serena just stood there and smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, I'm good.\" She grinned to herself as she walks to the turbolift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Back on the bridge, the communications officer speaks up to Mina.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ma'am, we are launching a communications beacon. It should be able to relay our transmission through the interference and get it to the other ship.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Excellent!\" Mina yelped. \"Make it so!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The communications officer nodded and made it so. Seconds later the bridge of the Crossroads appears on the viewer, clear as day, with Ark in the captain's chair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This is Commander Ark Madcock of the Federation starship, the U.S.S. Crossroads.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good day!\" Mina grinned. \"I'm Lt. Commander Mina Aino, of the U.S.S. Sisko. I appreciate the assistance you are planning on giving us, but I would request that you do not fire on the Kuno cube.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The weapons officer can be heard letting out a disappointed moan in the background. Ark tilted his head. \"How come?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We had an officer kidnapped and we currently have a boarding party over there attempting to recover her.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Right,\" Madcock noted. \"I'll inform Captain Mizuno. Do you need more security personal?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina ignored his question. \"Captain Mizuno? Ami Mizuno?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ark becomes confused. \"Uh, yeah.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"May I speak to her?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't see why not, hang tight.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ark mutes the channel and starts to talk into his communicator. Mina couldn't hear anything but she was adept enough at reading lips to know he said something about a 'crazy girl'. Soon the channel re-volumized.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Going to patch you into her ready room,\" Ark stated as he transferred the communication.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina grinned when the face of Ami appeared on the viewer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hey!\" Mina smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Mina!\" Ami smiled back. \"Glad to see you are well!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded. \"Same to you! Congratulations on the promotion!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami nodded. \"Thank you! Once we get everything taken care of we will have to get together.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded again. \"Yes, Serena, Lita, and Raye will be very happy to see you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They are all on board over there?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nodded. \"Except Lita, she's on the boarding party that is on the cube.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami checked a terminal just off-screen and nodded. \"As I said, we'll get together when things settle down. Now, if you guys are okay, we have a problem near the planet we need to deal with. Yell if you need anything.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nods and waves as communications are terminated. Shortly thereafter, Serena walks onto the bridge.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Did you get in contact with them?\" She asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nods. \"Good job.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena blushes. \"Thanks.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Guess who the captain of that ship is.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena thinks for a minute. \"Ami?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, it's-\" Mina spins around. \"Yeah, it is Ami. How did you know?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena shrugs. \"Lucky guess?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina sighs. \"She's going to come over after everything calms down.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"YAY!\" Serena jumps up and cheers. \"I'll go tell Raye!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SERENA!\" Mina yells.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah?\" Serena says, cowering slightly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Raye doesn't need to know right now. If she wants to be involved in what's going on she will come out of her little crawlspace and get involved.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena sighs and nods. She then goes back into the turbo lift.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They've boarded,\" George told his siblings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George got no answer.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He turns to see Kodachi standing above her brother with a very large katana pointed right at Kuno's gullet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"FOR RANMA!\" Kodachi screams.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George groans. He fires his phaser and knocks Kodachi right off her brother, the sword dropping inches from Kuno's neck.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno sits up and looks at George.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thank you, but I had her right where I wanted her.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George simply rolls his eyes and fires on Kuno. \"Now, you are both where I want you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George chuckles at his own witty remark and goes back to checking out the sensors. \"Four of them. Do they really think they will get you back with only four of them?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You guys are pathetic! Of course, they will!\" Akane cried from the corner she was tied up in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Eh, we'll see,\" George grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi starts to stir. She staggers to her feet and stumbles over to where George is seated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That hurts, you know.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George nods. \"Yeah, I know. You two need to declare a truce until we get this mission done with.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno also starts to stagger to his feet. \"A truce? With her?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"If the two of you can't get along for at least one day, then I will have to keep shooting you. And then I will have no use for Ranma or Akane and I will have to shove them out an airlock into open space.\" George explains.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"YOU WOULDN'T!\" Both Kuno and Kodachi bellow.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I would,\" George assures them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno sighs and looks at his sister. \"I suppose for the sake of Akane Tendo and the pig-tailed girl I can work with you on this.\" Kuno dryly states, extending his hand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi sighs back. \"I suppose for the sake of my darling Ranma I can also work with you.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi takes her brother's hand and shakes it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now, isn't that much better? Everyone getting along, huh?\" George smiles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi and Kuno both turn to their brother and give their best fake smiles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane just rolls her eyes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, this is going to work.\" Akane groaned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Quiet you,\" George ordered as he turned back to his terminal. He giggles a bit when he sees the blips on the display. George grins some more but then starts to frown. \"What the hell are they doing in my bathroom? Why the blue hell is there phaser fire?\" George frowns. \"I did flush, didn't I?\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"JESUS CHRIST RYOUGA!\" A sopping wet Ranma-chan screams as she climbs out of the bathtub. \"You scared the hell out of us!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Bwee?\" Ryouga oinks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell are you doing here anyway?\" Ranma asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Bwee!\" Ryouga replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma groans. \"How's the water coming?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita, who is also wet and on the other side of the room shooting a bucket of water with her phaser, replies. \"Getting there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Meow?\" Shampoo meows from the other room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"STAY OUT THERE!\" Ranma orders as she shudders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita grins as she begins to see some steam start to waft off of the water in the bucket. She sticks her finger into it and nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This should be warm enough, sir.\" Lita states. She then pauses. \"Or is it ma'am?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Just give me the water.\" Ranma glowers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita complies and hands Ranma the bucket. She quickly splashes herself and Ryouga. Ryouga, who is now naked, immediately scurries off to find his uniform.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma hands the bucket and what's left of the water to Lita who takes it into the other room and pours it on Shampoo. Lita walks back in and chucks the bucket into the corner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, that was a little weird.\" Lita acknowledges.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I thought you knew about the curses?\" Ranma asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I did, but till you see it actually happen, you really don't believe it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nods understandingly. He then returns his attention back to Ryouga who is just finishing putting on his uniform.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now, what the hell are you doing here?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Ryouga innocently whines. \"I want to help rescue Akane.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How do you end up as P-Chan?\" Shampoo asks, walking back into the room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga, doing his best not to notice Lita or Shampoo's very wet shirts, stammers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I am not very good at working the transporters. I ended up materializing right in this bathtub here. As soon as I fully materialized, poof; P-Chan.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The group murmured what seemed like an understanding murmur.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Here,\" Lita said, walking over to Ryouga. \"Give me your phaser rifle. I'll program it to be more effective on the drones.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga hands it to Lita. She begins to start to hit some things into her tricorder, but it simply chirps. The kind of chirp that you hear right before something goes wrong.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"This isn't a real phaser rifle!\" Lita gasped.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't have security clearance to get a real one out of the armory, so I just took the display model from the conference room.\" Ryouga shamefully acknowledged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma just rolls his eyes. \"What did you expect to fight with?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well,\" Ryouga begins. \"I just figured that when they saw I had a rifle they would surrender and let me take Akane back.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita and Shampoo just look at each other while Ranma stooge-slaps Ryouga across the top of his head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You mutton-chop!\" Ranma scowled. \"Lita, give him your hand phaser.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nods and tosses the phaser to Ryouga. He smiles and chuckles nervously.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Alright, let's get going,\" Ranma ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nods and walks out of the bathroom, making sure that the main room was still clear. She motions for the rest of them and walks up to the door to the corridor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We need to hang a left out of this doorway, and then travel pretty close to a kilometer down to the access ladder to the main control center,\" Ranma states while checking his tricorder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nods and slides the door open. She peaks outside, slowly, and sees nothing. She creeps out and into the hallway.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You can see all the way down the corridor.\" Lita states. \"And I don't see a soul.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nods and guides the others out into the hallway. Lita up front, with her rifle drawn. Ranma behind her, Shampoo behind him. Ryouga comes out last, covering their flank.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They get about a hundred meters down the corridor when all the lights go off. The group quickly put on their night vision goggles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"See anything?\" Shampoo asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nothing.\" Lita acknowledged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nothing,\" Ryouga stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga, do you have night vision goggles?\" Ranma asked cynically.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No,\" Ryouga replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma groans. \"Shampoo.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shampoo grabs Ryouga and shoves him behind Ranma and takes up Ryouga's spot on the flank. \"Nothing.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nods. \"Keep moving. Slowly.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A K-Mart-style intercom tone is heard.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Welcome aboard!\" George's voice states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Keep moving,\" Ranma whispered. He then raises his voice to speak with George. \"Where's Akane?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"She's right here in the corner,\" George stated. \"But it's going to take you far too long to get here that way.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma and Shampoo suddenly dematerialize from the group, their rifles being left behind, and dropping to the deck with a clang.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain!\" Lita calls out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm sorry!\" George says. \"I must have made you two lonely. Here. Have some playmates!\" George laughs maniacally until the transmission is cut off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Playmates?\" Ryouga asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly the lights turn back on and Ryouga and Lita are surrounded by the Kuno drones.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ah shit,\" Lita grumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I SHALL SMITE THEE!\" The drones all-state in unison.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, we're boned.\" Ryouga sighs.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where are the ships?\" Trevor asks as he lands the runabout in a crater on the dark side of Zima's farthest moon.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They are in a high orbit around the planet,\" Ami-Computer replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And they cannot see us?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nope.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good. And what about the Crossroads?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Short pause. \"They are 45 million kilometers away and are holding position. They apparently attempted to make contact with the other Federation ship. They then turned away and moved just outside of the radar range of the orbiting Zima ships.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Can we hail them?\" Trevor asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Not without alerting the security ships to our position,\" Ami-Computer replied. After a few seconds, she continues. \"I scanned them as they were firing on us. They can only maintain spaceflight for a little over nine more hours. It will take them months to search the area just&nbsp;around the close moons. It's very doubtful that if they don't locate us within the next few hours they will discontinue the search.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, so what, just wait it out?\" Trevor asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sure. We have enough reserve power to run life-support for sixteen more hours, with enough juice left to get outside of their radar range. And as long as we set our course right with the alignment of the moon, they won't detect us.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And we can contact the Crossroads as soon as those ships leave orbit?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yup.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor shrugs. \"I guess we've waited this long to be rescued, we can wait a bit longer.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor leans back and looks out his window at the inside of the crater they were parked in. It was not very interesting at all. Very dark, the only light is the light coming off of the runabout's red and green running lights.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor did see something that worried him while looking out of that window.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster had left the ship and was standing out in the crater. He was looking at the sky.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's he doing?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster begins to glow.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He starts to fade out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"-the-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He disappears.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"-hell?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster was gone. Trevor looked around frantically. \"Ami, where did he go?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't know.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why didn't you tell me he was leaving?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He didn't tell me he was leaving either.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"BAH!\" Trevor groaned. \"Scan for him!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That will require a proactive scan. They will be able to detect us.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't care. I want to know where he went.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor realized that he didn't want Foster to leave. It seemed that Trevor had grown accustomed to Foster being there.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"There is no need for any scans,\" Foster stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"GOOD GOD!\" Trevor screamed. \"You scared the hell out of me!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster sat back down and shrugged. \"Sorry.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you still want me to run that scan?\" The computer asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, you idiot!\" Trevor snapped.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"BAH!\" The computer replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor rolled his eyes and squatted down in front of Foster.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You don't need to be sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled at you earlier. I know you were only doing what you thought I wanted you to do.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster looked up at Trevor. \"I fixed things.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Huh?\" Trevor asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I went back and put life back into those people.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You can do that?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster laughed. \"You make it sound hard. Humanoid life is nothing but electrical currents.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, maybe physiologically. But LIFE is much more than that.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"See.\" Foster sighed. \"That's what I don't understand. Your people are killing each other and others even though your lives are so important.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor sits all the way on the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I had no intention of leaving those people dead. My people understand the meaning of life &ndash; the preciousness of life. When you yelled at me, I came to realize that you understand the preciousness, just not the meaning.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Huh?\" Trevor asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ever look at the stars and go, why am I here?\" Foster mused.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Not lately. After the war, I am just glad I am here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster laughed. \"Do you know why you are here?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor thought about this for a moment. \"According to science, I'm here to multiply.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Science is meaningless when it comes to the meaning of life. We are here for others. It's got nothing to do with yourself. Life was created to supplement other life.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor cocked his head. \"I'm not following.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster smiled. \"You're not supposed to. It took my people eons to figure it out.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The look on Trevor's face could only be described as utter confusion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Trevor, was Ami happy when you two were together?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor thought back. \"She never complained. Well, except when I came back from the gym.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster grinned. \"Do you believe in soul mates?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No.\" Trevor groaned. He then eyed Foster. \"Should I?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foster just grinned. \"It's not about you.\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good morning!\" A sweet female voice states to a Sisko crewman in the corridor of deck eight.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A very frightened crewmember cowers in preparation for the beating he is about to receive.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Until he realizes that she just said 'good morning.'</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Uh, good morning Commander Hino.\" He cautiously replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye smiled at him and continued her trek to her office. The crewman looks at another who watched the exchange.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You should go buy a lotto ticket. You're obviously having a very lucky day.\" The watcher states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other man just nods as he watches Raye hug another crewman who had dove for cover.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye finally reaches her office and steps in. She sees Jeff sitting at his desk.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander! Good morning!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good morning, Jeff!\" Raye grins as she sits down at her desk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So what's on tap for today?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye checks her computer. \"Well, we don't have any patients today. And considering we are under a security alert, we won't have any walk-ins, so I figured you could help me with this.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye tosses a PADD over to Jeff. He begins to read it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Letter of resignation? I thought we talked about this.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nods. \"We talked a lot. I think you and I both know that this is the wrong job for me. I'm no counselor. It's simply a resignation from this post.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't think there are any other positions open on this ship. Do you really want to be taken away from your friends?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye sighed. \"Well, I doubt two of them would really care that much.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Have you even talked to them?\" Jeff asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye scowled. \"You know, you have just as good of an ability to piss people off as you do cheer them up.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's a gift. Now, you need to talk to them.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now?\" Raye asked, pointing to the flashing red lights.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Eh, well as soon as the situation warrants.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Fine. But I am still turning that in.\" Raye states while pointing to the PADD in Jeff's hand.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"If you think that's best.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I do.\" Raye nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, I am not going to try and talk you out of it then,\" Jeff says, tossing the PADD back to Raye. \"Just make sure you tie up all your loose ends before leaving.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I might not have to leave,\" Raye replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, you might get to stay, but regardless, loose shoelaces will make you fall and break your nose.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye just laughed. \"Confucius you ain't.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jeff laughed as well.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George just laughs as Kodachi mauls a restrained Ranma with kisses. Ranma tries and tries to fend the assault off but to no avail.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane glowers at the display as she kicks Kuno across the room once more. \"RANMA!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, I'm tied up here, Akane.\" Ranma groans.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Akane rolls her eyes as she sends Kuno across the room again. Kuno hops up again, but instead of running back to Akane, he walks over to Ranma. He pulls his sister off of him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi starts to object, but George pulls her aside.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I heard Ranma say that he would LOVE to see you in that new dress you got!\" George lied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi beamed. \"I'll be back in six minutes!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi fluttered out of the room, black rose petals flying. One of the Kuno drones quickly follows her out, sweeping up the petals.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"My drones are not janitors.\" Kuno objected.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's him or you, dude.\" George dryly states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno grunts. \"Very well.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George rolls his eyes and walks into another room. Kuno grins at his adversary.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Where is the pigtailed girl? What have you done with her?\" Kuno demanded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Idano.\" Ranma mumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George walks back into the room with a bucket. \"Hey, Tatewaki! Look over there!\" He points in the direction of a hallway.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno, stupid as usual, looks in the direction he was pointed. George quickly douses Ranma with the water, making him female. Kuno groans at the trick.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Fool me, will you-\" Kuno shuts up when he sees a very wet female Ranma right in front of him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"OH PIG TAILED GIRL!\" Kuno exclaims, glomping onto Ranma with all his force.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"GET OFF ME!\" Ranma-Chan yells.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno snuggles Ranma some more, finally burying his head between her breasts. Ranma snaps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\" She screams. Ranma forces the ropes that are binding her to snap. She then sends Kuno flying through a wall and into the next room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"YUCK!\" She exclaims.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RANMA!\" Akane bellows.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh, sorry,\" Ranma says as she runs over and begins to untie Akane.

He turns to George. \"And you said it would only happen in my dreams!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George smiles and shrugs. Kuno opens his arms wide and grabs the pair.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The three of us! Together at last!\" Kuno hollers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Simultaneously Ranma and Akane send Kuno flying through the hole that one of the drones had just repaired. The drone watches his likeness shatter the wall.

You don't have your communicators.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma groans.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"D'oh!\" Akane grumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WRETCHED PIG TAILED GIRL!\" Kodachi screams as she comes plowing into the room, knocking the repair drone through the hole he just finished patching.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ugh.\" Ranma groans.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What have you done with my darling Ranma?\" Kodachi demanded.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He left,\" Ranma stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"WHAT?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He said he was going to go buy flowers for the pig-tailed girl.\" George lied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"DID HE NOW?\" Kodachi scowled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yup. And Akane Tendo!\" George grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"NOT IF THEY ARE BOTH DEAD!\" Kodachi screamed, ripping off her dress and stripping down to her rhythmic gymnastic outfit. She whips out her ribbons and quickly wraps the two together. She then pulls out a sword and prepares to strike a mighty blow.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Now, now,\" George says, walking over and grabbing the sword out of her hand. \"No need for that. Having them tied up will be plenty for now.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma and Akane groan and slide to the floor together. Kodachi flutters off to change once again, with the usual flower shower trailing behind her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The worker drone slowly crawls through the hole in the wall and grabs a broom and dustpan and follows Kodachi out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"You will never get away with this.\" Ranma grunts while trying to get out of her bindings.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh yeah?\" George grins. \"Soon as we get the engines back online we're out of here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Then what? Going to use the secret weapon on Earth?\" Ranma asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Huh?\" George asks. Then he remembers. \"Oh, no secret weapon. Just a scheme to get you out here. Would you believe that Tatewaki thought of it? Amazing that it worked!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"That is impressive.\" Ranma mused. Akane gives an elbow to the ribs to get her back on topic. \"What I mean is that the Sisko will not let you leave the system. And Lita, Shampoo, and Ryouga are on the ship. They will make their way up here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shampoo is in there, much in the same state you're in.\" George said pointing to a door labeled 'closet'. \"As for the other two, they are preoccupied at the moment.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma grumbles. \"Well, you know if we don't return before too long the Sisko will send more security personnel over.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George just shrugs. \"Whatever you want to believe.\" George laughs and starts to walk away. He stops and looks Ranma over once more before he leaves.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't know why you bother turning back into a boy. You've got a great rack.\" George starts laughing again and leaves the room.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma attempts to flip George off but ends up only jamming his finger into Akane's back.

He quickly takes aim at the drones and prepares to fire.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Wait!\" Lita screams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga shifts his eyes towards her. \"Why?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We need to come up with a plan. If we just shoot at them randomly they will adapt before we have killed all of them.\" She explains.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Fair enough, so what's the plan?\" Ryouga asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Still working on it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga groans as one of the drones charge them. He promptly fires and hits it dead center. The drone begins to spark and falls to the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"One down, ninety-nine to go!\" Ryouga chuckles cynically.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Okay, got it.\" Lita points to the floor where she has drawn up a hockey-style game plan.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We are going to go straight down the middle, forcing the drones on the side to swing at us, hopefully killing each other.\" Lita grins.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hopefully?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well.\" Lita chuckles nervously. \"No plan is 100% foolproof.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga nods. \"On your command.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita nods back. \"Let's roll.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga and Lita both begin firing. They start to take out the first batch of drones in the front. The plan begins to take fold. The drones on the side start to move in behind them as the other drones swing at them, causing a massive pile of Kuno drones on the floor. After exhausting all their phaser rifles and the hand phaser Ryouga brought with him all the drones lay dead on the floor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Hey, it worked!\" Lita stated, partially surprised.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga, panting from the running they did to get through the drones, nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita slowly walks up to the hatch to get to the command deck. She looks up and sees nothing. Slowly she climbs the ladder and sticks her head out at the command deck.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Looks clear.\" She calls down to Ryouga.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga climbs up the ladder underneath Lita and watches her finish climbing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nice.\" He quietly grins to himself.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What's that, Ensign?\" Lita calls back.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ice.\" Ryouga lies. \"I feel hot and could use some ice.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh,\" Lita replies as she pulls herself up out of the hatch. She helps Ryouga up as well and then pulls out her tricorder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After studying it for a moment she points down a short hallway, only about a hundred meters, and grins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Through that door is the main control center. In there I am picking up four bio-signs.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Is one of them Akane?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita rolls her eyes. \"I think so.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, what are we waiting for?\" Ryouga goes to pull out his hand phaser and then realizes that he doesn't have it anymore.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Dammit.\" Ryouga groans at Lita. \"Did you take the fact that we don't have weapons anymore into your plan?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita chuckles. \"Well, yes. We will just have to do this the old-fashioned way.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita cracks her knuckles and points to the door.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Charge!\" She yells.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Who are you?\" Kodachi asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both Ryouga and Lita stop in their tracks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I asked, WHO ARE YOU?\" Kodachi yells. \"And what are you doing on the great and noble cube of Kuno?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm Commander Lita Gosnell of the U.S.S. Sisko. We are here to retrieve our crew members.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So&hellip;\" Kodachi glowers. \"You are in love with my darling Ranma as well.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Huh?\" Lita asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shame on you. A married woman.\" Ryouga scolds.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita promptly stooge slaps Ryouga and returns her attention to Kodachi. \"Captain Saotome needs to return to his ship, and I am here to make sure that happens whether you like it or not.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi laughs at Lita's smugness. \"Is that so?\" Kodachi promptly rips off the dress she was wearing and strips down to her rhythmic gymnastics uniform.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What?\" Lita ponders as Kodachi throws a rubber ball at Lita. Lita easily dodges it and it hits the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ball explodes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What the hell?\" Lita asks as the air fills up with a pepper-like mist.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Paralysis powder.\" Kodachi grins as both Lita and Ryouga fall to the ground. \"Now, to finish you both off so that Ranma and I can be together forever!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yup, boned,\" Ryouga grumbles while struggling to move.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita starts to move her arm. She manages to grab her tricorder and flips it open. She punches in a series of keys with her moveable arm and shoves the tricorder close to Kodachi.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi walks over, kicks the tricorder behind her, and draws her katana.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So, the powder doesn't completely affect you then, does it?\" Kodachi begins to cackle. \"That's okay; my sword will take care of that!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita hits her communicator just as Kodachi begins the upward motion of the sword. The tricorder beeps three times and then explodes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kodachi is knocked forward in the blast, where she loses her grip on the blade. It falls, narrowly avoiding giving Ryouga a circumcision, and sticks into the ground.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita gets her leg moving and promptly kicks Kodachi over Ryouga. Kodachi growls.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SUCH INSOLENCE!\" She bellows.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Suddenly about one hundred Kodachi drones appear in front of the door to the control room. Kodachi cackles and disappears into the drones.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Try and take my darling Ranma away from me now!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita manages to start moving all her limbs again. She slowly staggers to her feet and pulls the sword out of the deck. She then drags Ryouga who is starting to regain movement, behind her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How come the powder didn't affect you?\" Ryouga pondered as she dragged him down the corridor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"While in Section 31 training I was drugged with just about every powder available. I developed a resistance.\" Lita replied as she dropped Ryouga and took up a defensive stance in front of him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga nodded as he began to stagger to his feet. \"Plan?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita shrugged. \"Kill 'em all?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga grinned as the first drone attacked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"They are made out of metal, right?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah,\" Lita replied.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ha.\" Ryouga smiled and he flipped over Lita and landed on the first drone.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"BAKUSAI TENKETSU!\" Ryouga screamed, placing his finger on the drone. It looked up at him and glowered, right before exploding, sending blue ooze and black rose petals everywhere.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita followed, slicing and dicing the drones as they attacked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But more and more drones were materializing as the others are killed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"How many could there possibly be?\" Ryouga gasped, dodging a katana strike from one of the drones.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I don't know, but we will never get through them at this rate,\" Lita grumbled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga backflipped and landed next to Lita. The pair is forced backward several meters, almost to the other end of the corridor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita sighed. \"It's a shame you don't have a ki attack like Ranma has.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I do.\" Ryouga acknowledged. \"But I need to be very depressed to use it, and I'm not.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita grinned. \"Is that because you made it with Mina?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga turned stoplight red.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Seriously though, if we don't get through them Akane and the others will be stuck here forever.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga nodded. \"Akane being stuck here forever makes me upset. But Ranma being stuck here forever counters it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita pondered what she could say that would make Ryouga so depressed that he could blast his way through the wall of drones.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lita noticed her wedding ring out of the corner of her eye. She looked at it and smiled.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ryouga, no one has told you this yet, and it was supposed to remain a secret, but I think you're ready.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga raised an eyebrow. \"Yeah?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Akane and Ranma are married.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga lowered the eyebrow and grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Nice try.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, seriously,\" Lita said as she begins to dig something out of her pocket. \"See, it's me and Gosnell at their wedding.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga eyes the picture. It shows Lita on the left, smiling as Gosnell is behind her giving her bunny ears. On the right side of the picture are Ranma and Akane. Kissing.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"When???\" Ryouga stammered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Several weeks ago.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga started to turn blue. \"Ranma&hellip;\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He's that way.\" Lita encouraged Ryouga by pointing the way through the drones.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"RANMA!!!!!!!!!!\" Ryouga screams.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">An extremely large glowing orb appears on his palms as blue flames start to weft off of him.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The drones all look at each other in fear.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh shit!\" They cry in unison as the orb grows to human size.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SHISHIHOUKOUDAN!\" Ryouga screams, sending the orb through the drones and the wall behind them.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No worries, family,\" Kodachi informs George and Tatewaki. \"The intruders are stuck behind a battalion of superior Kodachi drones.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you calling my drones lackluster quality?\" Tatewaki demands.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well look!

The blast continues past the group and through the next wall. And the next. And the next.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"HULL BREACH, COMMAND DECK!\" The tactical officer yells as debris comes flying out of the side of the Kuno cube.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"JESUS!\" Mina screams, hopping out of her seat. \"Scan for life signs!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"One!\" The officer replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Transport-\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Already done.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good job.\" Mina states. Serena stands and looks at Mina who is on her way back to the turbo lift. Mina looks at her. \"Take the bridge.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serena nods and rushes to her seat while Mina goes down the turbo lift.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In sickbay, a doctor is examining a man on the bed. \"How are you feeling?\" The doctor asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Cold.\" The man replies.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors to sickbay open and Mina walks in, followed by thirty security officers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Who are you?\" Mina asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George sits upon the bio-bed. George is no worse for the wear, with the exception of his clothes being torn and a big lump on his forehead. He also has the appearance of being scorched from top to bottom.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I'm George Kuno, of the Kuno Collective. Thanks a lot for saving my ass out there.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nods. \"Yeah, sure. Now, where are our people?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George lies back down. \"If they are still alive after that blast, they are in the command center.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina nods to a security guard who promptly scoots off to inform the others.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do you have emergency force shields on that deck?\" Mina asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, but they won't last for long. The ship will shut down for its regeneration cycle in thirty minutes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thirty minutes? You may have been cutting it very close.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No, once the ship is in its regeneration cycle it transfers all power from life support to the shields and the regeneration cells. The engines would then be completely repaired in six minutes. I then had it set to prematurely come out of its cycle, cloak, warp off, and then finish.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George sighs. \"It was the perfect plan. Just didn't plan on THAT!\" George waves his arms to simulate the explosion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Why are you being so helpful? You do realize that you are under arrest, don't you?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">George laughs. \"Man, I am getting too old for this crap and dealing with those maniacs. Take me to jail.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina shrugs to one of the security officers. She then turns to the doctor. \"Treat him.\" She turns back to the guard. \"Keep an eye on him, and as soon as he is released take him to the brig.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The guard nods and Mina walks off. She hits her communicator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Aino to Hino.\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye slinks forward to a doorway when her communicator chirps. She signals to the others to stop.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Go.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Are you okay?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah.\" Raye acknowledged. \"Little plaster fell on our heads and some steam hit us from the pointless steam ducts, but we are okay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good.\" Mina's voice sighed. \"Do you detect any bio-signs on the deck above you?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, seven,\" Raye stated looking at her wrist-mounted tricorder.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good they are still alive.\" Mina sighed in relief. \"Your team will have less than thirty minutes to get them and proceed to the beam out point. After that, the environmental force shield will collapse, and all life support will be diverted to the shields.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Got it. Out.\" Raye stated. She then turned to her team of twenty soldiers. \"You heard the lady, thirty minutes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She received a silent acknowledgment from the people on her team as they made their way down the corridor and to a hatch. Two of the soldiers walked up and started to push on the hatch.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It won't budge!\" One stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One deck up, what is left of the ceiling is lying on the floor, on top of the hatch. Ryouga and Lita both lie unconscious next to it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One deck down,&nbsp;Raye inspects her tricorder. \"There is several tons of debris lying on the hatch.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It will take us hours to cut a new hole.\" A soldier states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, so we will need to find another way,\" Raye replies. She checks her tricorder again. \"There is a turbo lift shaft eighty meters that way.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye points down a darkened corridor. Six of the soldiers nod and put on their night vision gear. They make their way to the lift and pry the doors open. They look in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"No access ladder.\" One states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The actual lift is three decks above us.\" Another one adds.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye comes over and checks her tricorder. \"Shit, and it's coming off its tracks. It could fall at any minute.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The soldiers all look at each other as Raye tries to come up with a plan.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"SNORT!\" Trevor snores. Foster, who had been reading about human history, begins to laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor begins to stir from the noise of Foster's boisterous laugh.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Whaaaa?\" Trevor grumbles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Your people make such funny noises when you are regenerating yourselves.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"He's usually mumbling about Ami.\" Ami computer pipes in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trevor swings to take a bat at the computer but ends up just whacking his hand on the console.

Trevor's ship goes dark. The engines shut down and the thrusters refuse to respond.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Computer, status!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">No reply.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">All of the panels on the Runabout go dark.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Shit.\" Trevor groans.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The tractor beam from the Zima ship begins to shorten.

Ami looks back and silently mouths \"They?\" to Ark. Ark shrugs and walks off. Ami returns her attention to the man on the screen.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"If you would like to come aboard I am sure we can work this out,\" Ami asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"A plea agreement? Is that what you think?\" The man asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"A compromise. I think that it is fairly obvious to you that you are not going to come out of an armed conflict in good shape. We wish to respect your laws, but you have to understand all the facts.\" Ami smiles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Well, I can't do anything with you, but I will go and pick up a magistrate, and we will meet back here in one hour to work out your 'compromise'.\" The captain states. The channel then closes and the ship turns around and heads back towards the planet.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ma'am?\" Vong chimes in.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"The Sisko is asking if we have any rock climbing equipment on board.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Do we?\" Ami asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Then tell them yes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vong pauses. \"I'm sorry, they also want to know if they can use it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, set a course over to them.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vong pauses again. \"The people on the cube need it.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ami nods to Vong, not really caring what he is saying anymore. She walks up to the tactical officer. \"Have security escort the Runabout passengers to the deck two observation room.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He nods as Ami walks into the turbo lift.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Fifteen minutes.\" One of the soldiers states to another who is waiting in a large open area.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yeah, yeah.\" He grumbles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A familiar noise is heard and in an instant, a blue flash of light is turned into the rock climbing equipment that they had requested.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two soldiers quickly scoop up the equipment and bring it over to the turbo lift shaft. At the shaft two soldiers are shooting the rails right below the lift, causing the rails to glow a hot red.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Any minute now,\" Raye mentions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Within seconds the heated metal bends and the lift drops past them and down the several decks with a bone-shattering crash at the bottom of the shaft.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The soldiers waste no time in setting up the climbing equipment. One works on using magnetic pads they got from the Crossroads to climb the side of the shaft.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He comes up right below the door to the command deck and drills three pegs into the wall. He then connects ropes to the pegs and allows the free end to drop down to the others.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He then finds the inside emergency release for the doors and releases them. He draws his weapon as he opens the door.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The deck is dark. The soldier activates his night vision and pulls himself up. He looks around and does not see any people. Down a couple of hundred meters though he can see where the hull of the ship was breached.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye pulls herself up and begins to scan with her tricorder. \"Two that way.\" She points in the opposite direction of the hole. Six soldiers go off to find the two. The rest come with Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Five up here,\" Raye states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The group walks a few meters when Raye's communicator chirps.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Go.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"We have Commander Hino and Ensign Hibiki.\" A soldier states.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Take them to the beam out point and transport back.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes ma'am.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">They continue down the corridor till they reach a pile of Kodachi drones on the floor. Raye scans them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"One here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A couple of the soldiers start to pull the drones off the pile while the rest stand ready to shoot. After a few seconds, there are no more in the pile.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"DEATH TO YOU!\" Kodachi screams as she hops up from the pile and charges the group. Everyone simultaneously turns and fires on Kodachi. Some of the shots deflect off of her, but several impacts her, sending her flying across the corridor.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A field medic walks up and checks her for a pulse. He looks to Raye and shakes his head.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nods and motions for the group to continue following.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After continuing down the corridor for about a hundred more meters they come to what appears to be the remains of the central control room.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lt;CLANG&gt;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What was that?\" Whispered Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lt;CLANG&gt;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's coming from over there.\" One of the groups whispers back while pointing at a door in the opposite corner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye slowly walks over to it and checks her tricorder. \"One bio-sign.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lt;CLANG&gt;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye draws her weapon and nods to another guard who hits the door release.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The doors slide open. Raye lowers her weapon.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander.\" Raye acknowledges.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A soldier kneels down and begins to remove the rope and duct tape keeping Shampoo immobile and silent. Once unbound, Shampoo stands and puts her arms out.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Give Shampoo rifle.\" Shampoo ordered.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye shakes her head. \"Sorry Commander. You need to return to the ship and go to sickbay.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nods to a couple of the soldiers. Shampoo begins to protest but the guards promptly lead her off and back towards the turbo lift shaft.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye and the remaining soldiers walk towards the open hull. Once at it, Raye touches the force shield simply to verify that there was one there.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">She then checks her tricorder. \"Under this pile of stuff, there are three.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The soldiers nod. One of them checks his tricorder as the others start to pull off debris.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Four minutes.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nods as she stands ready to fire. Within thirty seconds the pile was off. Ranma-Chan and Akane were both unconscious, with Akane having a gash on her forehead that was still bleeding slightly. Ranma appeared to be okay, with the obvious exception that she had an unconscious Kuno wrapped around her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The soldiers quickly cut the binds. Two of them hurriedly carry Akane off. The others can't seem to pry Kuno off of the captain.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Can you wake her up?\" Raye asked the field medic.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">He nods and pulls out a hypospray. He zaps Ranma with it. After a few seconds, Ranma weakly opens her eyes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"What happened?\" She slowly asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Explosion.\" Raye acknowledges. \"We're getting you off of here, but there is just one problem.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma smiles. \"Commander Hino. Nice to see you again.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, ma'am - sir. But, about the problem.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma continues to smile as she notices Kuno holding her.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Isn't that cute?\" She asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Sir?\" Raye asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The field medic runs a quick scan. \"He, uh, she has a concussion.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nods. \"Can you wake him up too?\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The medic complies and injects Kuno. Within a few seconds, Kuno is awakened.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Oh&hellip; Pigtailed girl&hellip;\" Kuno moans.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Kuno baby?\" Ranma asks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kuno wakes right up and sits up, letting go of Ranma in the process. \"Pig-tailed girl! Oh, how I love you!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye shoots Kuno before he has a chance to grab Ranma once again. Kuno falls over unconscious.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"KUNO BABY!\" Ranma yells.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye nods to the medic who quickly sedates Ranma. The remaining soldiers quickly assist and rush off with Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye takes one last look out of the hole. She smiles and laughs when she sees the Crossroads pull to within a few hundred meters of the Kuno cube.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Better late than never!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Commander!\" Raye's communicator chirps. Raye realizes how much time she has, or doesn't have, left and begins to run back towards the turbo lift shaft.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Right behind you &ndash;\" Raye is cut off by the sudden sound of the force field deactivating.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Debris begins to blow out of the hull breach. Raye is no exception. She is blown towards the hole. She manages to grab ahold of a stool stand for one of the consoles. She takes a deep breath and holds it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once all the air is evacuated from the area Raye swiftly lets go of the only thing that kept her from blowing out into space and begins to run back to the turbo lift.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye quickly becomes very weak from the running and the lack of oxygen. The temperature on the cube has also dropped well below zero degrees and is dropping more every second.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye slides down the rope and swings into the deck.

Ensign Ryouga Hibiki, please step up here.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ryouga looks around a second before realizing that the Admiral is talking about him. He quickly hops up and walks to the podium.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Ensign, for your actions on the Kuno Cube, and from the recommendation of your commanding officers, I hereby promote you from Ensign to Lieutenant, Junior Grade.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The crowd roars its approval again as the Admiral pins a second pip on the collar of Ryouga's dress whites. Ryouga smiles and shakes the Admiral's hand. After posing for a couple of photos he returns to his seat, beaming.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Again, Larson clears his throat and shuts everyone up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Due to the Sisko's valiant service, it has been decided that she is not up to the everyday tasks of a starship.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"It's a new galaxy, with new, unique threats. Therefore, let it be known that on this day, stardate 60206, the Federation Council has authorized Starfleet to create a Special Operations Unit, to be known as NEO. I hereby give this duty to the U.S.S. Sisko.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Quiet murmurs go throughout the cargo bay. Ranma stands and walks to the admiral as he is handed a PADD.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain,\" Larson states. \"You are hereby requested and ordered to take command of Operation Neo. While here your ship will receive a refit and you will be equipped with new, classified weapons and devices to help you in your future missions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Your first duty though will be to place someone in command of a detachment of special operations officers that will be assigned to your ship.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma looks at his crew, then back to the Admiral.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"With all due respect, sir.\" Ranma starts. \"I would request that any special operations team be assembled from my current crew.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Larson looked at Genma and Happosai. Genma seemed to be giving Ranma that &lsquo;shut up, dumbass' look. Happosai was grinning from ear to ear at the royal shellacking that Ranma was about to receive from Admiral Larson.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Larson looked back to Ranma who if he was afraid, wasn't showing it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Very well,\" Larson stated.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Happosai fell over. Genma grinned.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Who do you wish to command this team?\" Larson asked.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma stepped up to the podium.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I had the unfortunate duty of receiving a letter of resignation from my ship's counselor, Lt. Commander Raye Hino.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I have not known her for very long, but after talking to her friends and knowing that she almost died saving members of this crew, myself included, from the Kuno cube, I have no choice but to accept her resignation from her post and place her in command of this task force.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mina and Lita hug their friend in congratulations. The rest of the crew cheers loudly.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thank god.\" One crew member whispers to another. \"I don't think I could handle another session where I left feeling worse than I did when I showed up!\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other crew member nods in agreement.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye steps up to the podium. Ranma steps aside as the Admiral sizes up Raye.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I hereby place you in command of Special Operations Team Neo, and promote you to the rank of Commander.\" Larson smiled, removing the hollow pip from her collar and placing a full one on.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raye smiles at the Admiral and shakes his hand. She then smiles at Ranma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Thank you.\" She softly states before taking her seat.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Captain, Commander, I will need a list of the officers you want on the special ops team. They will then need to disembark for six weeks for training.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma nods.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Good. Now, you guys have deserved it, so I hereby place everyone, with the exception of the officers that will be needed for training, on shore leave.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So, let's all get drunk and play ping pong!\" Larson grins.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The crowd all cheers. Shampoo stands up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"ATTENTION!\" She yells.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone snaps to attention and shuts up.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Dismissed.\" Larson orders.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The occupants of the cargo bay slowly trickle out. Soon all that is left is Ranma, Akane, and Genma.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"So boy, I am glad to see that you finally grew some balls and married Akane.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ranma growls at his father. Akane just grins.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"Yes, I did,\" Ranma grumbles. \"Maybe someday you will too and go home to Mom.\"</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Genma starts flailing his arms as Akane and Ranma start to walk off.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO YOUR FATHER LIKE THAT YOU INGRATE!\" Genma yells, running after them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"I AM AN ADMIRAL!\" He adds.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>To Be Continued...</em></p>", "epilogue": true, "slug": "epilogue-mt3", "story": 4}}, {"model": "MoonTrekStories.comment", "pk": 3, "fields": {"commentor": "ewink", "comment": "This comment was stupid so I changed it slightly to make it less stupid.
