                Just a reminder, there are spoilers in most of, if not all of the articles, so if you're concerned with
                such things, you should absolutely stop here.

            <p>
                LCARS (an acronym for Library Computer Access/Retrieval System) is the Star Trek in universe OS their
                computers use. I have stolen it to make this database
                have the same name! The site is more than just a character database, although it does contain more
                information about the characters than anyone could possibly ever need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here you can also find information about most of the ships, background information behind some of the
                events that happened in the stories,
                but were not followed up on, and technical details behind the technology used. Basically, if no one
                cared about it, I created an entry for it!

                    It would be very difficult for Starfleet to do it's job without the many brave men and women who
                    staff their ships. It would be even more difficult to
                    tell a compelling story without having a diverse cast of characters in which to work with.

                <p>
                    The <em>Character</em> section of the LCARS Database has data on most of the characters in the
                    stories. Many of them you will find listed on the
                    character main page, but a number you will find as easter eggs throughout the reading.
                </p>

                <h4 class="bowlby"><a href="{% url 'LCARS:shipHome' %}">Ships</a></h4>
                <p>The ships are one of the most interesting and important part of any Star Trek story!</p>
                <p>
                    The <em>Ship</em> section of the LCARS Database has detailed specs of all of the main ships and some
                    of the secondary ships that appear in the Moon
                    Trek stories. Like with the character pages, some ships are listed, others have to be found through
                    exploring!

                <p>
                    The <em>Miscellanious</em> section of the LCARS database is where you will find information on
                    places, items, and technologies used in the Moon Trek
                    universe. Some of the stuff is Star Trek canon, some of it is pure right-from-ewink's-ass beta
                    canon. Regardless, you will find that I have put a decent
                    amount of effort into it. I think...
